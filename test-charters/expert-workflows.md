# Expert Workflows Charter: Veteran User Efficiency

## Investigation Plan

**EXPLORE:** Efficiency patterns and workflow optimisation across delivered features  
**AS:** Experienced marine licensing applicants and maritime consultants  
**BECAUSE:** Veteran users expect streamlined workflows and professional efficiency  
**LOOKING FOR:** Workflow friction, missing shortcuts, efficiency barriers, professional workflow gaps

**Duration:** 75 minutes  
**Priority:** High

## Scenario Context

### **THEME**

Investigate how well the marine licensing application supports experienced users who need to complete applications efficiently, often managing multiple projects simultaneously.

### **SETUP**

- **Primary Persona:** Amy (Veteran Applicant, Maritime Consultant)
- **User Context:** Third marine licensing application this year, familiar with regulatory requirements
- **Technology Context:** Desktop with multiple tabs, keyboard shortcuts preference, professional tools
- **Environmental Context:** Client deadlines, multiple applications, interruption-heavy office environment
- **Delivered Features:** Project name entry, task list navigation, public register consent

### **REALISTIC PRESSURES**

- **Time efficiency expectations** - Process should be faster than first-time users
- **Pattern recognition** - Expects familiar workflows from other government services
- **Multi-application management** - Handling several client projects simultaneously
- **Professional presentation** - Interface must support confident client interaction
- **Keyboard navigation preference** - Minimal mouse usage for speed

## Realistic Activities

### **Efficient Application Completion**

#### **Speed-Focused Project Name Entry**

- Navigate quickly to project name field using keyboard shortcuts
- Apply naming conventions learned from previous applications
- Test rapid completion without careful reading of guidance
- Use browser autofill and form memory features
- Attempt to reuse project naming patterns for consistency

#### **Professional Task List Usage**

- Quick scanning for completed vs remaining tasks
- Efficient navigation between task list and individual tasks
- Test browser back/forward button usage without losing work
- Attempt to bookmark specific application states for later return
- Handle multiple client applications in different browser tabs

#### **Streamlined Consent Decisions**

- Make consent decisions quickly based on client requirements
- Test rapid switching between consent options
- Efficiently provide withholding reasons when required
- Navigate conditional form behaviour at professional speed
- Maintain consistency across multiple client applications

### **Multi-Application Workflow Testing**

#### **Concurrent Application Management**

- Open multiple applications in different tabs for comparison
- Switch between different client applications requiring different approaches
- Copy information between applications for consistency
- Handle interruptions while managing multiple projects
- Test session handling across multiple browser tabs

#### **Professional Efficiency Patterns**

- Use keyboard shortcuts expected from other government services
- Minimise mouse usage throughout entire workflow
- Test rapid form completion with tab navigation
- Look for bulk operations or multi-application features
- Expect smart defaults based on user history

### **Client Service Scenarios**

#### **Real-Time Client Consultation**

- Complete application while on phone with client
- Navigate interface confidently during client meetings
- Handle client questions about process and requirements
- Make real-time changes based on client feedback
- Demonstrate professional competence through interface mastery

#### **Deadline Pressure Testing**

- Complete application under extreme time pressure
- Handle multiple applications due same day
- Balance speed requirements with accuracy for professional reputation
- Coordinate project names across planning applications and marine licensing
- Manage client expectations about process timing

## Evidence Framework

### **‚úÖ Positive Signals:**

- **Keyboard navigation fluency** - Tab order logical, shortcuts work intuitively
- **Recognition over recall** - Previous patterns easy to apply, smart suggestions available
- **Workflow continuity** - Smooth transitions between related tasks and sections
- **Multi-application support** - Easy to handle several projects simultaneously
- **Professional presentation** - Interface supports confident client interaction

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning Signs:**

- **Efficiency barriers** - Required steps that slow down experienced users unnecessarily
- **Pattern disruption** - Workflows that conflict with established government service conventions
- **Navigation inefficiency** - Mouse required for actions that should support keyboard shortcuts
- **Multi-tab conflicts** - Session handling problems when managing multiple applications
- **Professional friction** - Interface elements that undermine client confidence

### **ü§î Questions to Investigate:**

- How does application speed compare to other government services professionals use?
- What happens when users need to manage multiple applications simultaneously?
- How well does the interface support professional client interaction patterns?
- Are there opportunities for data reuse between related applications?

### **üí° Ideas to Explore:**

- Could keyboard shortcuts be added for common professional workflows?
- Are there opportunities for smart defaults based on user behaviour patterns?
- How might the interface better support multi-application management?
- What efficiency features would enhance professional confidence?
