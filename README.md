# Marine Licensing Journey Tests

End-to-end testing suite for the Marine Licensing service using **BDD (Behaviour Driven Development)** with **Cucumber**, **WebDriverIO**, and the **Screenplay Pattern**.

This project follows a user-centric approach to test automation, focusing on **who** does **what** and **why**, with clear separation between business logic and technical implementation.

## System Under Test

These journey tests cover:

- [marine-licensing-frontend](https://github.com/DEFRA/marine-licensing-frontend)
- [marine-licensing-backend](https://github.com/DEFRA/marine-licensing-backend)

### **Supporting Infrastructure**

**Dependencies (for GitHub/Docker execution):**

- **MongoDB** - Data persistence
- **Redis** - Session and caching
- **LocalStack** - AWS services simulation (S3, SQS, SNS, DynamoDB)

**Test Environments:**

- **Local Development** - Against locally running services
- **CDP Environments** - Live development/test environments
- **Docker Compose** - Containerised stack for CI/CD

## 🎯 Current Focus: Private Beta Exemption Notifications

We are currently focused on delivering a **private beta** that enables **members of the public to submit exemption notifications to the Marine Management Organisation (MMO)**.

### **Private Beta Scope**

- 🌊 **Exemption notifications** - Allow users to notify the MMO of activities that qualify for marine licensing exemptions
- 👥 **Public access** - External users (not just MMO staff) can create and submit notifications
- 📋 **Essential workflow** - Core user journey from initial notification through to submission
- 🔒 **Private beta constraints** - Limited user base for initial validation and feedback

### **Key User Journey**

The private beta focuses on enabling this core workflow:

1. **Start exemption notification** - User initiates a new exemption notification
2. **Provide project details** - Essential information about the marine activity
3. **Submit notification** - Complete submission to the MMO
4. **Receive confirmation** - User gets acknowledgement of successful submission

This testing suite validates the complete end-to-end journey for exemption notifications, ensuring the private beta delivers reliable functionality for real users.

## 📋 User Stories & Current Coverage

This project implements automated tests for marine licensing user journeys. See what functionality has been delivered:

**[📖 View Current User Stories & Test Coverage →](documentation/user-stories/README.md)**

**Currently Implemented:**

- ✅ **ML-1**: Provide project name and create exemption
- ✅ **ML-9**: View the task list and navigate between tasks
- ✅ **ML-12**: Provide or withhold public register content

Each user story includes acceptance criteria, screenshots, and links to corresponding feature files tagged with `@issue=ML-{number}` for full traceability between requirements and tests.

## 🧠 Modern Test Strategy

This project implements a **contemporary quality engineering approach** that builds upon traditional testing principles whilst embracing modern practices for better outcomes.

### **Evolution from Traditional Approaches**

Our strategy **builds upon and modernises** established testing principles, preserving essential intentions whilst adopting contemporary practices:

- ✅ **Same fundamental goals** - Quality software, risk management, regulatory compliance
- ⚡ **Better delivery speed** - Faster feedback cycles and automated quality gates
- 🔍 **Enhanced discovery** - Systematic exploration uncovers risks automation might miss
- 📊 **Evidence-based confidence** - Data-driven decisions rather than process compliance
- 🤝 **Collaborative quality** - Whole-team responsibility rather than testing handoffs

### **Built on Proven Testing Foundations**

Our approach respectfully builds upon methodologies developed by leading testing practitioners:

- **Context-Driven Testing** - _James Bach, Michael Bolton_ - Adaptive strategies that respond to domain context
- **Session-Based Test Management** - _John Bach_ - Structured time-boxed exploration with accountability
- **Scenario Testing** - _Michael Bolton_ - Rich, realistic user investigations
- **Heuristic Test Strategy Model** - _James Bach_ - Systematic thinking frameworks for test discovery

These proven methodologies are adapted for marine licensing domain requirements whilst preserving their essential insights and principles.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### **BDD + Screenplay Pattern**

- **📋 Feature Files** (`test/features/`) - Gherkin scenarios describing business behaviours
- **🎬 Step Definitions** (`test/steps/`) - Bridge between Gherkin and Screenplay
- **🎭 Screenplay Pattern** (`test-infrastructure/screenplay/`) - User-centric test automation
  - **Actor** - Represents the user performing actions
  - **Abilities** - What the actor can do (browse web, call APIs)
  - **Tasks** - High-level user goals (complete project name, apply for exemption)
  - **Interactions** - Low-level actions (click, verify, ensure)
- **📍 Page Objects** (`test-infrastructure/pages/`) - Locators and selectors only

### **Core Principles**

✅ **Self-documenting code** - No comments or JSDoc required  
✅ **Explicit naming** - Functions and variables express intent clearly  
✅ **Single responsibility** - Each component has one clear purpose  
✅ **Framework flexibility** - WebDriverIO encapsulated for easy switching

```

## 🎯 Writing Tests

### **BDD Guidelines**

- **Golden Rule**: Write Gherkin for clarity - others should understand without knowing the feature
- **Cardinal Rule**: One Scenario, One Behaviour
- **Structure**: Always Given → When → Then (in that order, no repeats)
- **Focus**: Customer needs and real user workflows

### **Example Feature**

```gherkin
Feature: Starting a new exemption notification

  Scenario: Provide a valid project name
    Given the project name page is displayed
    When entering and saving a project with a valid name
    Then the task list page is displayed
```

### **Step Implementation**

```javascript
// Maps to high-level Tasks
When('entering and saving a project with a valid name', async function () {
  await this.actor.attemptsTo(CompleteProjectName.with(faker.lorem.words(5)))
})

// Maps to verification Interactions
Then('the task list page is displayed', async function () {
  await this.actor.attemptsTo(EnsurePageHeading.is('Task List'))
})
```

```

## 📏 Coding Standards

### **JavaScript Standards**

- ❌ **No TypeScript** - JavaScript only
- ❌ **No JSDoc** - Self-documenting code
- ❌ **No Comments** - Expressive naming preferred
- ❌ **No `console.log()`** - Use Allure capture functions
- ❌ **No `throw Error`** - Use Chai assertions for proper test failures

### **Architecture Rules**

- **Tasks** → High-level user goals (`CompleteProjectName`, `ApplyForExemption`)
- **Interactions** → Single actions (`ClickSaveAndContinue`, `EnsureHeading`)
- **Page Objects** → Locators and dynamic selectors only
- **Abilities** → Framework encapsulation (WebDriverIO → `browse.the.web.js`)

### **File Naming**

- **JavaScript files**: `dot.case.js`
- **Assets**: `kebab-case` (static files)
- **Features**: `descriptive.name.feature` (e.g., `project.name.feature`, `validation.project.name.feature`, `task.list.feature`, `public.register.feature`)

## 🎭 Screenplay Pattern Usage

### **Actor Setup**

```javascript
// In step definitions
this.actor = new Actor('Alice')
this.actor.can(new BrowseTheWeb(browser))

// Remember data for later use
this.actor.remembers('projectName', 'My Project')
const name = this.actor.recalls('projectName')
```

### **Task Implementation**

```javascript
// High-level user workflow
export default class CompleteProjectName extends Task {
  static with(projectName) {
    return new CompleteProjectName(projectName)
  }

  async performAs(actor) {
    const browseTheWeb = actor.ability
    await browseTheWeb.sendKeys(
      ProjectNamePage.projectNameInput,
      this.projectName
    )
    await browseTheWeb.click(ProjectNamePage.saveAndContinue)
  }
}
```

### **Interaction Implementation**

```javascript
// Single verification action
export default class EnsurePageHeading extends Task {
  static is(expectation) {
    return new EnsurePageHeading(expectation)
  }

  async performAs(actor) {
    const browseTheWeb = actor.ability
    await browseTheWeb.expectElementToContainText('h1', this.expectation)
  }
}
```
