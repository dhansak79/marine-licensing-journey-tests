2. **🚨 Critical Anti-Over-Engineering Rules** - - Core refactoring and simplification
3. **🧪 Testing & Quality Strategy** - - Test approaches and methodologies
4. **🏗️ Development & Architecture** - - Code structure and patterns
5. **🔧 Refactoring & Code Safety** - - Safe change practices

## Examples

| Scenario     | Application                  |
