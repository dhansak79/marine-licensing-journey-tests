# Test Strategy Documentation Standards

## Core Principle

Core principles and approaches for the test strategy, balancing automated and exploratory testing to maximize risk coverage.

## When to Apply

- considering overall test strategy

## Key Guidelines

1. **How we approach testing** - - Methodologies and frameworks
2. **Why we make testing decisions** - - Rationale and principles
3. **What we intend to achieve** - - Goals and quality objectives
4. **How we think about testing** - - Heuristics and systematic approaches
5. **What has been implemented** - - "Currently implemented: ML-1, ML-9"

## Examples

| Scenario     | Application                  |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Code example | Follows established patterns |
