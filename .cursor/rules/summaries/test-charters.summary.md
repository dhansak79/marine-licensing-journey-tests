# Test Charter Creation and Enhanced Testing Methodology

## Core Principle

Test charters combine traditional SBTM with Bolton's scenario testing framework to create structured, realistic, and evidence-rich investigative testing sessions that reveal both technical issues and user experience insights.

## When to Apply

- Planning exploratory testing sessions
- Creating structured investigation plans
- Designing user-centered test scenarios
- Developing evidence collection frameworks
- Setting up test session management

## Key Guidelines

1. **Theme-based design** - Focus on testing themes across multiple features in realistic workflows
2. **Dual charter types** - Use Traditional SBTM (60-90 min) for technical validation and Scenario-Enhanced (90-120 min) for user investigations
3. **Persona alignment** - Connect charters to specific marine licensing personas and their authentic contexts
4. **Realistic pressures** - Include time constraints, interruptions, and cognitive load in test scenarios
5. **Evidence framework** - Define positive signals, warning signs, questions, and ideas to explore

## Examples

| Charter Type      | Use Case                   | Structure                             | Duration   |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Traditional SBTM  | Technical validation       | EXPLORE/WITH/TO DISCOVER format       | 60-90 min  |
| Scenario-Enhanced | User journey investigation | THEME/SETUP/ACTIVITIES/ORACLES format | 90-120 min |
