# Test Strategy Integration Rule

## Core Principle

Integration of different testing approaches into a cohesive strategy that addresses all quality risks through appropriate methods.

## When to Apply

- planning test strategy

## Key Guidelines

1. **HTSM (Heuristic Test Strategy Model)** - for systematic thinking
2. **domain-specific heuristics** - (MARINE, EXEMPTION) for marine licensing
3. **testing mnemonics** - (HICCUPPS, CRUD, SFDPOT) for comprehensive coverage
4. **exploratory testing charters** - for investigation sessions
5. **test pyramid principles** - (Unit > API > UI tests)

## Examples

| Scenario     | Application                  |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Code example | Follows established patterns |
