# Stop Over-Engineering and Making Stuff Up

## Core Principle

Comprehensive guide to combat over-engineering tendencies, advocating for minimal viable solutions and evidence-based implementations.

## When to Apply

- preventing over-engineered solutions

## Key Guidelines

1. **\*What I do** - wrong\*\*:
2. **Create massive arrays** - of fake data that aren't used
3. **Build complex generation** - methods for "all possible scenarios"
4. **Add persona-based generators** - when tests don't use personas
5. **Create comprehensive validation** - methods that aren't called

## Examples

| Scenario     | Application                  |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Code example | Follows established patterns |
