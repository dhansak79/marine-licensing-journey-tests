# Documentation Coherence & Quality Standards

## Core Principle

Principles for maintaining coherent documentation with consistent terminology, proper cross-references, and logical structure.

## When to Apply

- creating or updating documentation

## Key Guidelines

1. **All referenced files must exist** - - Every link to a charter, strategy document, or resource must point to an actual file
2. **Anchor links must match headings** - - Use exact heading text for anchor references (e.g., `#amy-veteran-applicant---efficiency-testing`)
3. **Consistent naming patterns** - - File names must match how they're referenced in READMEs and status tables
4. **Working navigation** - - All "Quick Access" tables and navigation sections must have functional links
5. **Charter status table** - must reflect actual file completion status

## Examples
