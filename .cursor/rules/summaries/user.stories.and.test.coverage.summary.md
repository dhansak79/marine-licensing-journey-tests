# User Stories and Test Coverage

## Core Principle

Methodology for linking user stories to test coverage, ensuring all requirements are properly tested and identifying gaps.

## When to Apply

- working with user stories

## Key Guidelines

1. **Clear acceptance criteria** - with specific validation rules
2. **Realistic scenarios** - that reflect actual user behaviour
3. **Domain-appropriate language** - using marine licensing terminology
4. **Screenshot descriptions** - that match actual UI implementation
5. **Screenplay pattern** -: Use tasks and interactions appropriately

## Examples

| Scenario     | Application                  |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Code example | Follows established patterns |
