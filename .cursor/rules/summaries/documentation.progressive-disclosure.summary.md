# Documentation Progressive Disclosure & Readability

## Core Principle

Make complex documentation immediately usable while preserving comprehensive content through a structured, layered approach that starts with actionable guidance and progressively reveals detailed information as needed.

## When to Apply

- Creating or restructuring documentation exceeding 200 lines
- Making complex information more accessible
- Reducing overwhelming documentation into manageable chunks
- Creating role-based documentation entry points
- Improving documentation usability and adoption

## Key Guidelines

1. **Immediate actionability over complete coverage** - Start with what people need to DO, not what they need to KNOW
2. **Three-layer content structure** - Main README (≤150 lines), detailed examples, advanced topics
3. **Role-based entry points** - Provide paths for different roles and experience levels
4. **Visual framework presentation** - Use simple visual structures instead of complex methodology descriptions
5. **Template-first approach** - Provide copy-paste templates before explaining theory

## Examples

| Documentation Element | Progressive Disclosure Approach                                                        |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Main README           | ≤150 lines with quick start, current focus, simple approach, key principles            |
| Experience Levels     | Separate sections for beginners, intermediate users, and advanced users                |
| Complex Workflows     | Visual tree structures with timeframes (setup 10min, exploration 60min, wrap-up 10min) |
| Detailed Content      | Move to supporting files (EXAMPLES.md, ADVANCED.md, TEMPLATES.md)                      |
