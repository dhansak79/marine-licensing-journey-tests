# Scenario Testing Methodology - Bolton's Framework

## Core Principle

Framework for creating realistic, scenario-based tests that simulate authentic user conditions, pressures, and goals.

## When to Apply

- implementing realistic user scenarios

## Key Guidelines

1. **Genuine user problems** - - Address real challenges, not invented scenarios
2. **Realistic pressure** - - Authentic time, environmental, and cognitive constraints
3. **Persona fidelity** - - True to character throughout investigation
4. **Evidence integrity** - - Document what actually happened, not what should have happened
5. **Guided structure** - - Clear mission and framework for investigation

## Examples

| Scenario        | Application                          |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Domain-specific | Application matches real-world usage |
