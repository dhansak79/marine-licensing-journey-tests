# General Rules
- Think step by step and plan before making any additions or changes to the code.
- Always make targeted edits when changing.
- Make sure you do not remove any text or code that is needed, validate you have made a targeted edit.
- Always summarise your changes to validate after making changes.

## Continuous Rule Enhancement
- After significant work or problem-solving, identify what patterns emerged that could benefit future work
- Assess which existing rules could be enhanced with new learnings and practical insights
- Propose specific additions to rules rather than letting valuable knowledge remain only in conversation history
- Ask: "What did we learn that would help future work of this type?" and offer to capture it systematically
- Treat the rule system as a living knowledge base that evolves with practical experience
