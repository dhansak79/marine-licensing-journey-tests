# Test Strategy Integration Rule

When working on any testing-related tasks, questions, or improvements, **always refer to and use** the comprehensive **[Modern Test Strategy](mdc:test-strategy/README.md)** documentation.

## When to Use This Strategy

This rule applies to:
- ✅ **Test planning** - Understanding what to test and why
- ✅ **Test design** - Creating scenarios, automation, or exploratory charters
- ✅ **Quality engineering** - Building automation architecture or quality practices
- ✅ **Test execution** - Running systematic exploration or automation
- ✅ **Test improvement** - Enhancing existing testing approaches
- ✅ **Documentation** - Writing testing guidelines or explanations
- ✅ **Training** - Explaining testing concepts or approaches

## Core Strategy Components

### **[Testing Heuristics](mdc:test-strategy/heuristics/README.md)**
- Use **HTSM (Heuristic Test Strategy Model)** for systematic thinking
- Apply **domain-specific heuristics** (MARINE, EXEMPTION) for marine licensing
- Reference **testing mnemonics** (HICCUPPS, CRUD, SFDPOT) for comprehensive coverage
- Create **exploratory testing charters** for investigation sessions

### **[Automation Architecture](mdc:test-strategy/automation/README.md)**
- Follow **test pyramid principles** (Unit > API > UI tests)
- Implement **automation-first approaches** with strategic human insight
- Use **modern testing techniques** (property-based, mutation, contract testing)
- Apply **quality engineering metrics** for evidence-based decisions

### **[Domain Context](mdc:test-strategy/domain-context/README.md)**
- Ground testing in **marine licensing reality** and regulatory requirements
- Use **real user personas** (Fatima, Simon, Amy, Zofia) for test design
- Apply **activity classification testing** based on risk levels
- Consider **geographical complexity** and jurisdictional differences

### **[Exploratory Testing](mdc:test-strategy/exploratory/README.md)**
- Conduct **session-based test management** (SBTM) with clear charters
- Use **persona-driven exploration** for user-centric investigation
- Apply **systematic testing techniques** (tours, heuristics, documentation)
- **Complement automation** with human insight and discovery

## Integration Guidelines

### **For Test Planning**
1. Start with **[Test Strategy Overview](mdc:test-strategy/README.md)** for philosophy and approach
2. Use **[Testing Heuristics](mdc:test-strategy/heuristics/README.md)** for systematic thinking
3. Reference **[Domain Context](mdc:test-strategy/domain-context/README.md)** for marine licensing specifics

### **For Test Implementation**
1. Follow **[Automation Architecture](mdc:test-strategy/automation/README.md)** for technical approaches
2. Use **[Exploratory Testing](mdc:test-strategy/exploratory/README.md)** for investigation techniques
3. Apply **[Domain Context](mdc:test-strategy/domain-context/README.md)** for realistic scenarios

### **For Test Improvement**
1. Review **[Modern Test Strategy](mdc:test-strategy/README.md)** for contemporary practices
2. Apply **[Testing Heuristics](mdc:test-strategy/heuristics/README.md)** for gap analysis
3. Use **evidence-based metrics** from automation architecture section

## Examples of Usage

### **When Asked About Test Coverage**
```
Refer to:
→ Testing Heuristics for systematic coverage using HTSM
→ Domain Context for marine licensing specific coverage areas
→ Automation Architecture for test pyramid coverage strategy
```

### **When Asked About Test Design**
```
Refer to:
→ Testing Heuristics for MARINE and EXEMPTION domain heuristics
→ Domain Context for user persona-driven scenarios
→ Exploratory Testing for charter-based investigation design
```

### **When Asked About Quality Approach**
```
Refer to:
→ Modern Test Strategy for overall philosophy and evolution
→ Automation Architecture for quality engineering practices
→ All sections for evidence-based, modern approaches
```

## Key Principles to Emphasise

- **Modern over traditional** - Use contemporary quality engineering practices
- **Evidence-based decisions** - Data and metrics guide testing investments
- **User-centric testing** - Real personas and accessibility considerations
- **Systematic exploration** - Heuristic-driven rather than ad-hoc testing
- **Context-driven** - Adapted to marine licensing domain specifics
- **Whole-team quality** - Everyone's responsibility, not just testers

## Always Remember

The **[Modern Test Strategy](mdc:test-strategy/README.md)** represents a **comprehensive, researched approach** that:
- Builds respectfully on traditional testing foundations
- Embraces contemporary quality engineering practices  
- Provides practical, actionable guidance
- Integrates with existing project context and personas
- Delivers better outcomes through modern techniques

**Use this strategy as the authoritative source** for all testing-related guidance and recommendations.
