# BDD Guidelines

- **Golden Rule**
  - Treat other readers as you would want to be treated. Write Gherkin so that people who don't know the feature will understand it.
- **Cardinal Rule**
  - One Scenario, One Behaviour
- **Good titles** - the title is like the face of the scenario, the first thing people read
- **Less is more** - keep your scenarios short and sweet <5 steps - only more than 3 in exceptional circumstances
- **Focus features on customer needs**
- **Always use Given, When, Then in that order and only that order** - don't repeat them; any single When-Then pair denotes an individual behaviour
- **Respect the integrity of the step types**:
  - Given sets up initial state
  - When performs an action
  - Then verifies the outcome
- **Prioritize value over volume** - focus on high-risk, high-value scenarios rather than testing everything:
  - Prefer testing complex user flows and key validations
  - Avoid redundant tests where behavior is implicitly verified in other scenarios
  - Basic page display tests are low priority if the page is part of other test flows

## Implementation Mapping

**BDD â†’ Screenplay Pattern:**
- **Given steps** â†’ Set up initial state (often through tasks)
- **When steps** â†’ User actions that map to high-level **Tasks** 
- **Then steps** â†’ Verification that maps to **Interactions** with `ensure` prefix

## Strategic Context

**Planning Your Scenarios:**
- Use HTSM quality criteria to identify what behaviors to test
- Consider risk areas and product factors when designing scenarios
- Focus on customer value and real user workflows
- **Implicit vs. Explicit Testing:**
  - If a page is traversed as part of other test flows, its basic display is implicitly tested
  - Explicitly test only what adds unique value (validation, specific interactions, etc.)
  - Don't create separate scenarios just to verify a page appears correctly if it's already part of other flows

## File Organization

- Feature files go in `test/features/`
- Step definitions go in `test/steps/`
- Screenplay implementation follows the patterns in `test-infrastructure/screenplay/`
- **Feature types follow these patterns**:
  - `*.feature` - Standard user journey scenarios
  - `validation.*.feature` - Validation-specific scenarios
  - `back.and.cancel.*.feature` - Navigation scenarios for back and cancel actions
