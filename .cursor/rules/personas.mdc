# Marine Licensing User Personas

Instead of duplicating persona information, this rule directs you to use the established personas in the main documentation directory.

## Core Persona Framework

Our testing uses established user personas from the documentation directory. These personas represent real user types with authentic needs, constraints, and expectations.

### Primary Personas

All detailed persona information can be found in: `documentation/personas/`

| Persona    | Role                        | Key File                                                           |
| ---------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Fatima** | Case officer (MMO staff)    | [Fatima - Case officer](../../documentation/personas/fatima-case-officer.md)       |
| **Simon**  | Marine officer (MMO staff)  | [Simon - Marine officer](../../documentation/personas/simon-marine-officer.md)     |
| **Amy**    | Veteran applicant           | [Amy - Veteran applicant](../../documentation/personas/amy-veteran-applicant.md)   |
| **Zofia**  | Novice individual applicant | [Zofia - Novice applicant](../../documentation/personas/zofia-novice-applicant.md) |

## Using Personas in Testing

For comprehensive guidance on using these personas in testing, refer to the [Personas README](../../documentation/personas/README.md).

### Key Testing Implications

When creating tests, consider these persona-specific implications:

- **Zofia (Novice)**: Test first-time user journeys, plain language, guidance effectiveness, and error prevention
- **Amy (Veteran)**: Test efficient repeat processes, information reuse, multi-application management, and professional workflows
- **Fatima (Case Officer)**: Test read-only views, enquiry handling, and support workflows
- **Simon (Marine Officer)**: Test field access, compliance verification, and risk assessment features

## Applying Personas in Test Creation

### For Automated Testing
- Use personas to create realistic test data profiles
- Design assertions that reflect persona expectations
- Create user journeys that follow authentic persona paths

### For Investigative Testing
- Embody personas during exploratory sessions
- Apply realistic constraints and pressures
- Document findings from persona perspectives

### For Acceptance Criteria
- Reference relevant personas in acceptance criteria
- Include persona-specific scenarios in Gherkin
- Validate solutions against persona needs

## Integration with Test Strategy

These personas directly inform our test strategy by:
- Guiding risk-based test prioritisation
- Informing scenario-enhanced test charters
- Shaping acceptance criteria and BDD scenarios
- Directing focus for accessibility and usability testing

For scenario-based testing approaches using these personas, see [scenario-testing.mdc](./scenario-testing.mdc).
