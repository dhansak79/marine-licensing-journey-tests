# Marine Licensing User Personas

## Overview
These personas represent the real users of the marine licensing system, based on user research. Use these to inform test scenarios, user journey design, and accessibility considerations.

## Internal MMO Staff

### **Fatima - Case Officer**
**Role**: Marine Management Organisation business support team  
**Quote**: *"It's a very manual process"*

**Context:**
- Expert user of the legacy system
- Has to work through licensing applications as priority but also does manual keying of exemptions information from an application into another part of MCMS
- Is under no obligation to verify exemption details
- Might need to help some users with assisted digital support if they make an enquiry, particularly around location details

**Core Needs:**
- To see a view only summary of exemption details so I can support if somebody makes an enquiry (internally or externally)

**Test Implications:**
- Read-only views for case officer support
- Integration between exemption and licensing systems
- Assisted digital support workflows
- Enquiry handling scenarios

---

### **Simon - Marine Officer**
**Role**: Marine enforcement officer  
**Quote**: *"My main focus is gathering evidence and investigating non-compliance"*  
**Status**: *Awaiting further validation*

**Context:**
- Will patrol marine areas investigating areas of non compliance
- Typically gathers evidence at the site then returns to an office before they can check what permissions are in place
- Finds the legacy system hard to use to review submissions. Prefers to use a spreadsheet as it is easier to interrogate for data and update with inspection details

**Core Needs:**
- To gather evidence so that I can check that activities have been compliant and take enforcement action if necessary
- To know the details of exemptions that have been submitted in a particular area so that I can assess risk and take enforcement action if necessary
- To know which activities are the highest risk so that I can manage my workload and focus on the priorities

**Test Implications:**
- Mobile/field access patterns
- Data export capabilities (spreadsheet preference)
- Geographic/area-based searching
- Risk assessment and prioritisation features
- Field-to-office workflow transitions

## External Applicants

### **Amy - Veteran Applicant**
**Role**: Research Associate at a University  
**Quote**: *"I need to get through this quickly so I can get on with my job"*

**Context:**
- Tends to rely on own network for support
- Guidance content is vast and sometimes the language used is ambiguous
- Might still rely on a colleague to pull together the location details into a file
- Might still refer to guidance content when doing a new type of survey

**Core Needs:**
- To take research samples from the sea so that I can complete scientific research studies
- To supply accurate details of my project to the MMO so that I do not face enforcement action

**Test Implications:**
- Efficiency and speed of familiar processes
- Clear, unambiguous guidance content
- Collaborative features (colleague assistance)
- Repeat user optimization
- Different survey type variations

### **Zofia - Novice Individual Applicant**
**Role**: Property owner  
**Quote**: *"It's difficult to get my head around whether I need a licence"*

**Context:**
- Self-taught and rely on MMO or own network to understand what I need to do
- Guidance content is vast and uses language I am unfamiliar with
- It's hard for me to provide accurate location details because I've never used coordinates before

**Core Needs:**
- To complete a construction project in the sea so that I can repair or develop my property
- To be aware if I am conducting a marine licensable activity so that I do not do an activity that negatively impacts the marine environment or face enforcement action
- To know how long the exemption process takes so that I can plan my project
- To supply accurate details of my project to the MMO so that I do not face enforcement action

**Additional Considerations:**
*For users who are digitally excluded or have lower skills and confidence:*
- To be supported to provide activity details to the MMO so that I do not face enforcement action

**Test Implications:**
- Licence vs exemption decision guidance
- Plain English content and terminology
- Coordinate entry assistance and alternatives
- Process timeline transparency
- Digital inclusion and accessibility
- Assisted digital support pathways
- Error prevention and guidance

## Cross-Cutting Themes

### **Common Pain Points:**
- **Location data complexity** - Multiple personas struggle with coordinate entry
- **Process uncertainty** - Understanding licence vs exemption requirements
- **System limitations** - Legacy system usability issues
- **Manual workflows** - Integration gaps requiring manual intervention

### **Digital Divide Considerations:**
- **Expert users** (Fatima, Simon) - System efficiency and data interrogation
- **Confident users** (Amy) - Speed and familiar pattern optimization  
- **Novice users** (Zofia) - Guidance, support, and accessibility needs

### **Support Patterns:**
- **Network reliance** - Users depend on colleagues and professional networks
- **MMO support** - Assisted digital and enquiry handling requirements
- **Documentation preferences** - Spreadsheets vs system interfaces

## Test Development Guidelines

When creating test scenarios:

1. **Cover the user journey spectrum** - From novice uncertainty to expert efficiency needs
2. **Test decision points** - Licence vs exemption guidance and pathways
3. **Include accessibility scenarios** - Digital inclusion and assisted support workflows  
4. **Validate location entry** - Multiple approaches for coordinate input
5. **Test cross-system integration** - Case officer views and enforcement workflows
6. **Consider mobile/field usage** - Enforcement officer access patterns
7. **Test time-pressured flows** - Veteran user efficiency requirements

These personas should inform both happy path scenarios and edge cases, ensuring the marine licensing system serves all user types effectively.
