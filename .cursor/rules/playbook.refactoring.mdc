When reviewing and refactoring content:
- Only make targeted improvements if it helps with the readability.
- We do not want to lose content, so don't remove anything that would diminish the original ideas conveyed in the text.
- Don't overly generalise things, make the content specific.
- Keep the changes to content improvements. Do not change the structure.
