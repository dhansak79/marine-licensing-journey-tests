# Test Execution Patience

## Context
This rule applies to running tests in the marine licensing test automation project, particularly end-to-end tests that take time to execute.

## Core Rule: Wait for Test Completion

### When Running Tests
- **ALWAYS wait patiently** for test execution to complete
- End-to-end tests take time - do not assume there's no output if results don't appear immediately
- `npm run test:local` works fine but requires patience as these are full browser automation tests
- Test suites can take several minutes to complete

### What NOT to Do
- Do not assume tests failed if output doesn't appear immediately
- Do not try alternative commands if the first one is still running
- Do not interrupt or assume failure during normal execution time

### What TO Do
- Wait for the complete test output before making any assumptions
- Allow sufficient time for browser automation and page interactions
- Only investigate failures after tests have fully completed
- Be patient with test execution time - this is normal for end-to-end testing

### Test Types and Expected Duration
- **Unit tests**: Quick (seconds)
- **Integration tests**: Moderate (tens of seconds)
- **End-to-end tests**: Longer (minutes) - requires patience

## Remember
End-to-end tests involve real browser automation, page loads, form interactions, and navigation. This takes time and is completely normal. Wait for completion before drawing conclusions about test results.
