## How These Rules Work Together

```
Strategic Level       ‚Üí  HTSM guides what to test and why
User-Centred Level    ‚Üí  Personas inform who you're testing for and their real needs
Writing Level         ‚Üí  BDD ensures clear, maintainable scenarios
Architecture Level    ‚Üí  Project Structure + Screenplay Pattern organise implementation
Application Context   ‚Üí  Application Under Test provides technical and domain knowledge
Code Level            ‚Üí  Code Generation + Clean Code rules ensure quality and consistency
Development Practices ‚Üí  Playbook rules guide style, process, and refinement
```

## Maintenance Notes

- Each rule file is independently maintained
- Rules are enforced through Cursor IDE integration
- Updates should maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Consider impact across all rule files when making changes
