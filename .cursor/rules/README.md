5. **Writing scenarios?** Read [`bdd.rules.mdc`](./bdd.rules.mdc) for clear Gherkin that reflects real user needs
6. **Building test automation?** Follow [`screenplay-pattern.mdc`](./screenplay-pattern.mdc) for implementation
7. **Planning test coverage?** Use [`htsm.mdc`](./htsm.mdc) for strategic thinking and [`user.stories.and.test.coverage.mdc`](./user.stories.and.test.coverage.mdc) for coverage assessment

## Maintenance Notes

- Each rule file is independently maintained
- Rules are enforced through Cursor IDE integration
- Updates should maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Consider impact across all rule files when making changes
- Refactoring guidance is modularised for targeted reference while maintaining cross-document consistency

_These rules represent the collective knowledge and best practices for maintaining high-quality, maintainable test automation in the Marine Licensing Journey Tests project._
