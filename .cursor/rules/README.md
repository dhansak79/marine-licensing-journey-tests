## Maintenance Notes

- Each rule file is independently maintained
- Rules are enforced through Cursor IDE integration
- Updates should maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Consider impact across all rule files when making changes
- Refactoring guidance is modularised for targeted reference while maintaining cross-document consistency
