# Cursor Rules - Master Index

This directory contains the complete set of rules and guidelines for the Marine Licensing Journey Tests project. These rules ensure consistency, quality, and maintainability across the codebase.

## Rule Files Overview

### üéØ **Testing Strategy & Approach**

#### [`htsm.mdc`](./htsm.mdc)

**Heuristic Test Strategy Model (HTSM) v6.3**

- Strategic framework for test thinking and planning
- Risk-based testing approaches
- Quality criteria categories and product factors
- Contextual guidance for comprehensive test coverage

#### [`bdd.rules.mdc`](./bdd.rules.mdc)

**BDD Guidelines**

- Golden Rule: Write Gherkin for clarity and understanding
- Cardinal Rule: One Scenario, One Behaviour
- Given/When/Then integrity and ordering
- Best practices for scenario writing

### üèóÔ∏è **Architecture & Implementation**

#### [`project-structure.mdc`](./project-structure.mdc)

**Project Structure Standards**

- Directory organization and file placement rules
- Naming conventions (dot.case for JS files, kebab-case for assets)
- Clear separation between features, steps, pages, and screenplay components

#### [`screenplay-pattern.mdc`](./screenplay-pattern.mdc)

**Screenplay Pattern Standards**

- Actor, Abilities, Tasks, and Interactions implementation
- Code examples and usage patterns
- Encapsulation of WebDriverIO for framework flexibility
- User-centric approach to test automation

#### [`code.generation.mdc`](./code.generation.mdc)

**Code Generation Rules**

- JavaScript-only approach (no TypeScript)
- Self-documenting code principles
- Allure reporting integration
- Error handling with Chai assertions
- Tasks vs Interactions guidelines

### üìù **Development Practices & Style**

#### [`playbook.general.rules.mdc`](./playbook.general.rules.mdc)

**General Rules**

- Step-by-step thinking and planning approach
- Targeted editing practices
- Validation and change summarisation
- Code quality assurance

#### [`playbook.styleguide.mdc`](./playbook.styleguide.mdc)

**Style Guide**

- British English standards for DEFRA
- Professional tone requirements
- GOV.UK content design guidance
- UK Government style manual compliance

#### [`playbook.refactoring.mdc`](./playbook.refactoring.mdc)

**Refactoring Guidelines**

- Targeted improvement principles
- Content preservation strategies
- Readability enhancement focus
- Structure maintenance rules

## How These Rules Work Together

```
Strategic Level       ‚Üí  HTSM guides what to test and why
Writing Level         ‚Üí  BDD ensures clear, maintainable scenarios
Architecture Level    ‚Üí  Project Structure + Screenplay Pattern organise implementation
Code Level            ‚Üí  Code Generation rules ensure quality and consistency
Development Practices ‚Üí  Playbook rules guide style, process, and refinement
```

## Getting Started

1. **New to the project?** Start with [`project-structure.mdc`](./project-structure.mdc) to understand the layout
2. **Writing scenarios?** Read [`bdd.rules.mdc`](./bdd.rules.mdc) for clear Gherkin
3. **Building test automation?** Follow [`screenplay-pattern.mdc`](./screenplay-pattern.mdc) for implementation
4. **Planning test coverage?** Use [`htsm.mdc`](./htsm.mdc) for strategic thinking

## Maintenance Notes

- Each rule file is independently maintained
- Rules are enforced through Cursor IDE integration
- Updates should maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Consider impact across all rule files when making changes

_These rules represent the collective knowledge and best practices for maintaining high-quality, maintainable test automation in the Marine Licensing Journey Tests project._
