# ML-16: Choose Site Location Input Method

## User Story

**AS** an applicant  
**I WANT** to choose how I provide the site location details for my marine project  
**SO THAT** I can pick the option that works best for me  

## Background

There are a number of different ways that the user can provide their location/site details. Because of this, there are a series of initial 'routing' questions to get the user to the correct functionality to provide their site details. This story represents the first page in this logic - asking the user if they want to upload their coordinates in a file, or if they want to key them in manually. Note that we are not asking the user if they want to draw on a map yet, since this functionality is not available yet. It will be available when the DEFRA flood map is available for us to integrate with. 

## Resources

- [How do you want to provide site location? page in prototype MVP](mdc:marine-licensing-journey-tests/marine-licensing-journey-tests/https:/prototype-url-placeholder)
- [Link to data dictionary](mdc:marine-licensing-journey-tests/marine-licensing-journey-tests/https:/data-dictionary-placeholder)

## Out of Scope

- Navigation to the next page in the flow will be covered by a separate story
- This story does not cover the survey link and other links in the header
- This story does not cover the links in the footer

## Questions and Answers

**Q:** How will this page be affected by the 'multiple sites' functionality?  
**A:** When multiple sites is implemented, there will be an additional page that appears before this page.

## Screenshots

### User Journey Flow Diagram
![User Journey Flow Diagram]

The flow diagram shows the complete site location journey:
- Starting from the task list, users select "Site details"
- At the "How do you want to provide the site location?" page (this story), users have two options:
  - "Upload a file"
  - "Enter coordinates manually"
- If "Upload a file" is selected, users choose between Shapefile or KML formats
- If "Enter coordinates manually" is selected, users choose between "Centre and circle" or "Coordinate list"
- Each option leads to specific coordinate system choices (WGS84 or OSGB86) and data entry screens
- All paths eventually lead to a "Review site details" page

### Site Location Options Page
![Site Location Options Page]

The GOV.UK page shows:
- Standard GOV.UK header with "Apply for a marine licence" service name
- Beta banner with feedback link
- Back link to return to the previous page
- "Hammersmith pontoon construction" as the project name caption
- Main heading: "How do you want to provide the site location?"
- Two radio button options:
  1. "Upload a file with the coordinates of the site"
  2. "Enter the coordinates of the site manually"
- "Continue" and "Cancel" buttons
- Standard GOV.UK footer with licensing information
