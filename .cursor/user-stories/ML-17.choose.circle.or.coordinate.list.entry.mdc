# ML-17: Choose Circle or Coordinate List Entry

## User Story

**AS** an applicant  
**I WANT** to choose how I provide the location details for my marine project  
**SO THAT** I can pick the option that works best for me  

## Background

This is the second page in the site details flow, if the user has chosen to enter coordinates manually in the first screen. This page will allow the user to choose between manually entering a list of coordinates and entering a single coordinate point and a width to form a circle.

## Resources

- Link to "How do you want to enter the coordinates?" page in prototype MVP
- Link to data dictionary

## Out of Scope

- Navigation to the next page in the flow will be covered by a separate story
- This story does not cover the survey link and other links in the header
- This story does not cover the links in the footer

## Questions and Answers

N/A

## Screenshots

### Screenshot 1: Flow Diagram

The flow diagram shows the user journey for providing site location information. After selecting "Enter coordinates manually" on the first screen, the user reaches "How do you want to enter the coordinates?" page where they can choose between "Centre and circle" or "Coordinate list" options. Each option then leads to different paths for coordinate system selection (WGS84 or OSGB86) and subsequent data entry screens.

### Screenshot 2: Coordinate Entry Options Page

This screenshot shows the "How do you want to enter the coordinates?" page with:
- GOV.UK header with "Apply for a marine licence" service name
- Beta banner
- Back link
- "Hammersmith pontoon construction" project name as caption
- Page heading "How do you want to enter the coordinates?"
- Two radio button options:
  1. "Enter one set of coordinates and a width to create a circular site" with helper text "Use this if you only have the centre point of the site"
  2. "Enter multiple sets of coordinates to mark the boundary of the site" with helper text "Use this if the site is a custom shape with more than one point"
- Continue and Cancel buttons
- Footer with administrative links
