# ML-695: RSD - Change Links in "Activity Details" Summary Card (File Upload and Manual Entry)

## User Story

**AS** an applicant  
**I WANT** to be able to change answers from the "Review site details" page  
**SO THAT** I can ensure that my sites are correct

## Background

This story covers the ability to make changes to the answers given in the "Activity details" summary card of the "Review site details" page, for sites that have been manually entered AND sites that have been provided via file upload.

## Resources

Link to "Change link behaviour analysis" in Mural

Links to prototype are in the comments (they are too big to fit in the description field)

## Out of Scope

Change links outside of the "Activity details" summary card.

## Questions and Answers

**Q.** If they change from YES to NO (i.e. changing from same dates to different dates) - in this case, the activity date row in the "Activity details" summary card is removed, and each site summary card gains its own activity dates row. Will each individual site be populated with the dates that were previously applied to all sites, or will the date fields for each site just be blank?

**A.** Discussed with Tom Mearns. Agreed that the dates against each site will be defaulted to the previous value from the summary card.

**Q.** If they change from NO to YES (i.e. changing from different dates to same dates) - in this case, the activity date row in the "Activity details" summary card is added, and each site has its activity dates row removed. Will the activity dates row be populated or blank? If populated, what with?

**A.** Discussed with Tom Mearns. Agreed that the dates in the summary card will be left blank.

## Standard Behaviour

**"Back" link** - when I select the "Back" link (if present), I will be returned to the page I was on immediately prior to the current page. Any changes I made on the current page will be discarded.

**"Cancel" link** - when I select the "Cancel" link (if present) I will be returned to the task list. Any changes I made on the current page will be discarded. Note: Cancel links are not present when making changes from the Review site details page as per the acceptance criteria.

**"Change" links** - when I select a "Change" link, I will be taken to the appropriate page to modify the information, with the page pre-populated with my previous answer(s).

**Displaying validation errors** - if any validation errors are triggered, they will be displayed in standard GDS format i.e. [error summary](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-summary/) at the top of the page, and [error message](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-message/) against the specific item that triggered the error. The wording of error messages should be verified against the data dictionary.
