# Marine Licensing UAT Delivery Summary

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the marine licensing features delivered for UAT testing, clarifying which requirements are current and which have been superseded. The application has evolved from supporting single-site notifications to comprehensive multi-site functionality, resulting in some earlier user stories being enhanced or replaced.

## Current Status of Delivered Features

### ‚úÖ Core User Journey (Fully Delivered)

- **ML-228**: Provide site name ‚úÖ
- **ML-419**: Are all activity dates the same? ‚úÖ
- **ML-416**: Activity dates for single manual entry site ‚úÖ
- **ML-420**: Activity dates for multiple sites ‚úÖ
- **ML-417**: Activity description for single manual entry site ‚úÖ
- **ML-421**: Activity description for multiple manual entry sites ‚úÖ
- **ML-362**: Add another site from review site details ‚úÖ

**File Upload (KML & Shapefile):**

- **ML-389**: Activity dates for single uploaded site ‚úÖ
- **ML-390**: Activity description for single uploaded site ‚úÖ
- **ML-75**: Provide dates for multiple uploaded sites ‚úÖ

- **Efficient Workflow**: "Add another site" button enables streamlined multi-site entry
- **File Upload Multi-Site**: KML and Shapefile formats can contain multiple sites with automatic extraction
- **Flexible Activity Information**: Choose to apply same dates/descriptions to all sites or provide individual values per site

#### Site Review and Management

## Important Notes for UAT Testing

### 1. Multi-Site Context

When testing activity dates and descriptions:

- **For single site entries**: The system goes directly to date/description entry
- **For manual multiple sites**: The system first asks if dates/descriptions are the same for all sites (ML-114, ML-419)
- **File uploads (KML/Shapefile)**: Can contain multiple sites automatically parsed and extracted (ML-232)
  - System asks if dates are the same for all sites (ML-119)
  - System asks if descriptions are the same for all sites (ML-120)
  - Supports both KML and Shapefile formats with multiple site geometries
  - Each site is displayed with its map, coordinates, and individual activity information

### 2. Superseded vs Enhanced Features

| Original Story               | Status   | Current Implementation                       |
| ---------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| ML-10 (Activity dates)       | ENHANCED | Now site-specific via ML-416/420             |
| ML-11 (Activity description) | ENHANCED | Now site-specific via ML-417/421             |
| Other core features          | ACTIVE   | Continue to function as originally specified |

## Known Considerations

### Features Currently In Development (@wip)

The following features are marked as Work In Progress and tests are temporarily disabled:

- **Check Your Answers**: Being updated to display multi-site activity dates and descriptions
- **Dashboard - View Details**: Being updated to display multi-site activity dates and descriptions for submitted notifications
- **Login Redirect to View Details**: Dependent on View Details multi-site support

**Testing Impact**: These scenarios are marked `@wip` and will not run until the multi-site implementation is complete.

### Top-Level Task Removal (Future)

- **ML-10** (Activity Dates) and **ML-11** (Activity Description) top-level tasks will be removed
- Activity information is now captured within the Site Details flow
- Tests for standalone activity dates/description tasks will be refactored after application changes

### Session Management

- Session data persists between navigation steps
- Switching between file upload and manual entry requires careful state management
- Previous answers are retained when using back navigation
- Multi-site data is maintained across "Add another site" workflows
- Intelligent routing preserves user decisions about shared dates and descriptions

### Validation Rules

- All original validation rules from single-site stories apply to multi-site contexts
- Date validation: Must be today or future, end date after start date
- Description: Maximum 4000 characters
- Coordinates: Support for both WGS84 and OSGB36 systems
- File uploads: Both KML and Shapefile formats validated for correct structure and coordinate data

### D365 Integration

- Real submission to D365 requires test environment configuration
- Dashboard reflects actual D365 case status
- Reference numbers are generated upon successful submission

## Recommendations for UAT Team

1. **Start with single-site scenarios** to understand core functionality
2. **Progress to multi-site scenarios** to test enhanced features
3. **Test file upload multi-site functionality** (ML-75, ML-76, ML-119, ML-120, ML-232):
   - Upload KML files with multiple sites
   - Upload Shapefile archives with multiple sites
   - Test "same dates/descriptions for all sites" workflow
   - Test "different dates/descriptions per site" workflow
   - Verify all sites display correctly with maps and coordinates
4. **Test "Add another site" workflow** (ML-362) with intelligent conditional routing
5. **Try mixed site types** - combine circular and polygon sites in one notification
6. **Test site review functionality** (ML-361, ML-608) with enhanced summary cards and scalable site display
7. **Test site deletion capability** (ML-233) including confirmation dialogs and site renumbering
8. **Test navigation flows** including back button and cancel behaviours
9. **Verify data persistence** across the user journey
10. **Check validation messages** for clarity and helpfulness
11. **Test coordinate system variations** (WGS84 and OSGB36) within multi-site notifications
12. **Confirm submission process** works as expected in your test environment
