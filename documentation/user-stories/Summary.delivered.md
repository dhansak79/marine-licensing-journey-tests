# Marine Licensing UAT Delivery Summary

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the marine licensing features delivered for UAT testing, clarifying which requirements are current and which have been superseded. The application has evolved from supporting single-site notifications to comprehensive multi-site functionality, resulting in some earlier user stories being enhanced or replaced.

## Important Notes for UAT Testing

### 1. Multi-Site Context

When testing activity dates and descriptions:

- **For single site entries**: The system goes directly to date/description entry
- **For multiple sites**: The system first asks if dates/descriptions are the same for all sites
- **File uploads**: Can contain multiple sites automatically parsed from KML/GeoJSON files

### 2. Superseded vs Enhanced Features

| Original Story               | Status   | Current Implementation                       |
| ---------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| ML-10 (Activity dates)       | ENHANCED | Now site-specific via ML-416/420             |
| ML-11 (Activity description) | ENHANCED | Now site-specific via ML-417/421             |
| Other core features          | ACTIVE   | Continue to function as originally specified |

## Key Testing Scenarios

### 1. Single Site Journey

1. Create project (ML-1)
2. Enter activity dates directly (ML-416)
3. Enter activity description directly (ML-417)
4. Choose coordinate entry method (ML-16)
5. Enter site details (various stories based on method)
6. Check answers (ML-82/139/140)
7. Submit (ML-84)

### 2. Multiple Sites Journey

1. Create project (ML-1)
2. Choose multiple sites option
3. Decision: Same dates for all sites? (ML-419)
4. Enter dates (ML-420)
5. Decision: Same description for all sites? (ML-114)
6. Enter descriptions (ML-421)
7. Enter site details for each site
8. Review site details with "Add another site" option (ML-362)
9. Optionally add more sites with intelligent routing
10. Check answers (ML-140)
11. Submit (ML-84)

### 3. File Upload Journey

1. Create project (ML-1)
2. Choose file upload (ML-69)
3. Upload KML/GeoJSON file (ML-70)
4. Review extracted sites (ML-74)
5. Provide activity information per site
6. Check answers (ML-140)
7. Submit (ML-84)

### 4. Mixed Site Types Journey (Advanced Testing)

1. Create project (ML-1)
2. Enter first site as circular site
3. Use "Add another site" to add polygon site (ML-362)
4. System intelligently skips previously answered questions
5. Add third site with different coordinate system
6. Verify mixed site types display correctly
7. Check answers showing all site variations (ML-140)
8. Submit with comprehensive multi-site data (ML-84)

### 5. Site Review and Management Journey

1. Create project with multiple sites (ML-1)
2. Enter first site manually (any coordinate type)

4. Add additional sites using "Add another site" functionality (ML-362)
5. Review multiple sites with scalable display (ML-608)
6. Test delete functionality for individual sites (ML-233)
7. Verify confirmation dialog for site deletion
8. Confirm site renumbering after deletion
9. Test deletion of last site (returns to task list with "Not yet started" status)

## Known Considerations

### Session Management

- Session data persists between navigation steps
- Switching between file upload and manual entry requires careful state management
- Previous answers are retained when using back navigation
- Multi-site data is maintained across "Add another site" workflows
- Intelligent routing preserves user decisions about shared dates and descriptions

### Validation Rules

- All original validation rules from single-site stories apply to multi-site contexts
- Date validation: Must be today or future, end date after start date
- Description: Maximum 4000 characters
- Coordinates: Support for both WGS84 and OSGB36 systems

### D365 Integration

- Real submission to D365 requires test environment configuration
- Dashboard reflects actual D365 case status
- Reference numbers are generated upon successful submission

## Recommendations for UAT Team

1. **Start with single-site scenarios** to understand core functionality
2. **Progress to multi-site scenarios** to test enhanced features
3. **Test "Add another site" workflow** (ML-362) with intelligent conditional routing
4. **Try mixed site types** - combine circular and polygon sites in one notification
5. **Test site review functionality** (ML-361, ML-608) with enhanced summary cards and scalable site display
6. **Test site deletion capability** (ML-233) including confirmation dialogs and site renumbering
7. **Test navigation flows** including back button and cancel behaviours
8. **Verify data persistence** across the user journey
9. **Check validation messages** for clarity and helpfulness
10. **Test coordinate system variations** (WGS84 and OSGB36) within multi-site notifications
11. **Confirm submission process** works as expected in your test environment
