## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1 - Display Page

**GIVEN** I have opted to enter sites manually  
**AND** I have opted to input one location only  
**AND** I have input the date correctly  
**WHEN** I click continue on the activity dates screen (see ML-416)  
**THEN** I will be taken to the "Activity Description" page to enter the description for the single site

### AC2 - Page Behaviour

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Activity description" page  
**WHEN** the page is loaded  
**THEN** the page appears and behaves as per the prototype:

- the project name will appear as the page caption
- the description text box is blank
- the form instructions should read "Briefly describe what you'll do, how you'll do it, and why. For example, 'Collect a 0.1 cubic metre seabed sample by day grab from a workboat for particle size analysis'." instead of "Provide details about what you plan to do at this location."

**NOTE** - this is a reuse of the screen built in https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-11

### AC3 - Continue

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Activity Description" page  
**AND** I have provided a valid description  
**WHEN** I select the "Continue" button  
**THEN** I will continue to the "How do you want to enter the coordinates?" page

Screen validation will be reused from https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-11

The button on https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-11 said "Save and continue" instead of "Continue"

### AC4 - Cancel

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Activity Description" page  
**WHEN** I select the "Cancel" option  
**THEN** I am returned to the task list:

- the status of the task will not be updated
- any description that I have provided so far will be discarded

### AC5 - Back

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Activity Description" page  
**WHEN** I select the "Back" option  
**THEN** I am taken to the activity dates screen (ML-416)

## Standard Behaviour

**"Back" link** - when I select the "Back" link (if present), I will be returned to the page I was on immediately prior to the current page. Any changes I made on the current page will be discarded.

**"Cancel" link** - when I select the "Cancel" link (if present) I will be returned to the task list. Any changes I made on the current page will be discarded.

**Displaying validation errors** - if any validation errors are triggered, they will be displayed in standard GDS format i.e. [error summary](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-summary/) at the top of the page, and [error message](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-message/) against the specific item that triggered the error. The wording of error messages should be verified against the data dictionary.
