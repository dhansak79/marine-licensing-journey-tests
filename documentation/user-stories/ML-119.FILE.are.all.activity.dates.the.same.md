# ML-119: FILE - Are All Activity Dates the Same?

## User Story

**AS** an applicant  
**I WANT** to re-use the same set of activity dates for multiple uploaded sites where appropriate  
**SO THAT** I do not have to keep re-entering the same dates

## Background

As part of the multiple sites work, it is necessary for the applicant to provide a set of activity dates for each site they have uploaded for their notification. Previously, the user only had to provide dates for the notification as a whole.

In reality, where the uploaded file contains multiple sites, the dates will frequently be the same for all sites. In this case, the service will ask the user if they wish to re-use the same set of dates for all of their sites.

Note that the logic around re-using dates is slightly different for manually entered sites (circular sites and polygon sites) so that is covered under a separate story).

## Resources

- Link to "Are the activity dates the same for every site?" page in multiple sites prototype v2

## Out of Scope

Logic around re-using dates for manually entered sites (circular sites and polygon sites) is covered under a separate story

Navigation to the next pages in the flow will be covered by a separate story

This story does not cover the survey link and other links in the header

This story does not cover the links in the footer

## Questions and Answers

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1 - Display page

**GIVEN** I am providing sites via file upload  
**AND** there is more than one site in the uploaded file  
**WHEN** my file is successfully uploaded  
**THEN** the "Are the activity dates the same for every site?" page is displayed

**NOTE** - if there is only one site in the uploaded file then I will not see this page

### AC2 - Page behaviour

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Are the activity dates the same for every site?" page (as per AC1)  
**WHEN** the page is loaded  
**THEN** the page appears as per the prototype  
**AND** the project name will appear as the page caption  
**AND** neither radio button is selected by default

### AC3 - Validation

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Are the activity dates the same for every site?" page  
**AND** I have not selected a radio button on the page  
**WHEN** I select the "Continue" button  
**THEN** I will see an error message - "Select whether the activity dates are the same for every site"

### AC4 - Continue

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Are the activity dates the same for every site?" page  
**AND** I have selected either radio button on the page  
**WHEN** I select the "Continue" button  
**THEN** I will remain on the same page (navigating to the next page will be covered in other stories)

**NOTE** - if I select "Yes", I will be asked to provide the dates on the next page, and if I select "No", I will be able to provide individual dates later in the process. This is for information only, and does not form part of the acceptance criteria for this story.

### AC5 - Cancel

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Are the activity dates the same for every site?" page  
**WHEN** I select the "Cancel" option  
**THEN** I am returned to the task list:

- the status of the task will not be updated
- any answers that I have provided so far will be discarded
- any file I have uploaded will be discarded

### AC6 - Back

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Are the activity dates the same for every site?" page  
**WHEN** I select the "Back" option  
**THEN** I am taken to the previous page in the flow i.e. the "File upload" page  
**AND** the file that I previously selected on that page will be defaulted in DO WE WANT TO DO THIS? IS IT DOABLE?

## Standard Behaviour

**"Back" link** - when I select the "Back" link (if present), I will be returned to the page I was on immediately prior to the current page. Any changes I made on the current page will be discarded.

**"Cancel" link** - when I select the "Cancel" link (if present) I will be returned to the task list. Any changes I made on the current page will be discarded.

**Displaying validation errors** - if any validation errors are triggered, they will be displayed in standard GDS format i.e. [error summary](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-summary/) at the top of the page, and [error message](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-message/) against the specific item that triggered the error. The wording of error messages should be verified against the data dictionary.
