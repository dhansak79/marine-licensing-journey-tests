# ML-84: Submit notification

## User story

**AS** an applicant  
**I WANT** my exemption to be submitted to MMO  
**SO THAT** MMO is properly notified of the activity I will be conducting under the exemption

## Background

Once the user has reviewed their notification on the "Check your answers" page and is happy with it, they can press the "Confirm and send" button to submit it. The notification will be submitted, and the user will see a confirmation page with their unique reference number.

## Resources

- Link to "Check your answers" page in prototype MVP

## Out of scope

The generation of the unique reference number for the notification is not covered by this ticket. It is covered by [ML-21](https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-21).

This story does not cover the survey link and other links in the header.

This story does not cover the links in the footer.

This story does not cover the "What do you think of this service?" survey link.

This story does not cover the email confirmation.

## Questions and answers

**Q.** Will the submission be asynchronous, and if so, does there need to be an interim 'submitted' status held within CDP, until we get a response back from Dynamics confirming the status of the case?

**A.** The submission will initially be an asynchronous 'fire-and-forget' transaction, managed from a CDP queue. When the case is successfully received in Dynamics, the record in the queue will be marked as successful. For notifications, CDP will not receive any updated status, and CDP will not need to query Dynamics to check status, since we know that the business process is for it to be closed immediately. For later application types such as sample plans, marine licences etc, where there is a status workflow on the Dynamics side, the dashboard will need to obtain the latest status for all cases from Dynamics, but for exemptions it does not.

**Q.** Do we need to cover any error handling in this story?

**A.** Error handling will be covered by a separate ticket to be linked by Vasu.

**Q.** Can we prevent the user from submitting more than once? If so, how?

**A.** This will be covered in [ML-334](https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-334).

**Q.** Where does the user go from the "Confirmation" page? Should we have a link to the dashboard in the "What happens next" section?

**A.** The user can utilise the "Projects home" link in the header to go to the dashboard (once that feature is implemented). This page will need to be tested to establish whether users are able to see and use this link, or whether further CTA(s) are needed in the body of the page.

## Acceptance criteria

### AC1 - Submit notification

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Check your answers" page (see [ML-82](https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-82))

**WHEN** I select the "Confirm and send" button

**THEN** the unique reference number will be generated for the notification (see [ML-21](https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-21))  
**AND** the notification will be submitted to the case management system  
**AND** the notification will contain:

- the unique reference number for the notification e.g. "EXE/2025/10036"
- a reference to the applicant that created it (i.e. the Defra ID for the customer) NOTE - we may not have this information until we have the login feature, so we may need to hardcode it in the short term
- a reference to the organisation that the applicant was working for (if applicable) NOTE - we may not have this information until we have the login feature, so we may need to hardcode it in the short term
- the application type - in this case "EXE" for "Exempt activity"
- the project name e.g. "Hammersmith pontoon project"

### AC2 - Post-submission

**GIVEN** I have selected the "Confirm and send" button

**WHEN** my notification has been submitted as per AC1

**THEN** my notification will be marked as submitted  
**AND** the "Confirmation" page will be displayed:

- the page will appear as per the prototype
- the unique reference number (see [ML-21](https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-21)) will be populated in the green box

## Standard behaviour

**"Go back to your project" link** - when I select the "Go back to your project" link (if present), I will be returned to the task list. Any changes I made on the current page will be discarded.

**Displaying validation errors** - if any validation errors are triggered, they will be displayed in standard GDS format i.e. [error summary](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-summary/) at the top of the page, and [error message](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-message/) against the specific item that triggered the error. The wording of error messages should be verified against the data dictionary.
