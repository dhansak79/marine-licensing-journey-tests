# ML-142: CYA Project Summary Card IAT

## User Story

**AS** an applicant  
**I WANT** to see information about the activity that I am undertaking  
**SO THAT** I can have a clear understanding of the activity and the associated legislation

## Background

In story https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-111, we receive a set of contextual information from the Fivium IAT, about what the user had done within IAT (what activity, they are proposing to do, what article of the legislation their work falls under etc). In this story, we present this information back to the user, so that they have an understanding of the context of their exemption notification. They will also be able to download a PDF copy of the answers they provided in IAT, for their records.

This IAT context is shown to users on two pages, Check your Answers and View Details. This story covers both pages as the component is loaded on both pages and is identical.

**"Cancel" link** - when I select the "Cancel" link (if present) I will be returned to the task list. Any changes I made on the current page will be discarded.

**Displaying validation errors** - if any validation errors are triggered, they will be displayed in standard GDS format i.e. [error summary](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-summary/) at the top of the page, and [error message](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-message/) against the specific item that triggered the error. The wording of error messages should be verified against the data dictionary.
