# ML-139: Check your answers - polygon site

## User Story

AS an applicant
I WANT to see the answers I have provided
SO THAT I can check everything is correct before I submit my notification

## Background

Once the user has completed all the tasks on the task list, they will be able to access the "Check your answers" page, which will play back all their answers and allow them to verify that the answers are OK, ready for submission of their notification.

This story builds upon https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-82, which defines the behaviour of the "Check your answers" page for a circular site, extending the behaviour to cater for the display of a polygon site (where the user has provided a list of coordinates to form a polygon shape). As such, this story is only focussed on the "Site details" card, and the remaining behaviour of the page (including any out of scope items listed in ML-82) remains unchanged.

It is worth noting that the "Site details" summary card being displayed here is the same as implemented in https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-121, and code re-use may be beneficial.

## Out of scope

This story does not include the "Map view" part of the "Site details" summary card; the rendering of the site coordinates onto a map will be delivered under a separate ticket

This story does not cover the ability to make changes to site information (via the "Change" link)

This story does not cover behaviour on the "Check your answers" page outside of the "Site details" card

This story does not cover the survey and other links in the header

This story does not cover the links in the footer

## Questions and answers

TBC

## Screenshots

### Screenshot 1: Check your answers page showing polygon site details with WGS84 coordinates

This screenshot shows the complete "Check your answers" page for a polygon site using WGS84 coordinate system. The page displays:

- Project details section with project name
- Activity dates section showing start and end dates
- Activity details section with description and activity type information
- Site details section showing:
  - Method of providing site location: "Manually enter multiple sets of coordinates to mark the boundary of the site"
  - Coordinate system: "WGS84 (World Geodetic System 1984) Latitude and longitude"
  - Start and end points: showing latitude and longitude coordinates
  - Point 2: showing second set of coordinates
  - Point 3: showing third set of coordinates
  - Map view: placeholder area for future map implementation
- Public register section showing consent status

### Screenshot 2: Check your answers page showing polygon site details with OSGB36 coordinates

This screenshot shows the same "Check your answers" page layout but for a polygon site using OSGB36 coordinate system. The key difference in the site details section shows:

- Coordinate system: "OSGB36 (National Grid) Eastings and Northings"
- Start and end points: showing eastings and northings coordinates
- Point 2: showing second set of eastings and northings
- Point 3: showing third set of eastings and northings

## Acceptance criteria

### AC1 - "Site details" card for polygon site

GIVEN I am viewing the "Check your answers" page
AND I have provided details of a polygon site
WHEN I view the content of the "Site details" summary card
THEN I see the following information -

Method of providing site location - populated with fixed text: "Manually multiple sets of coordinates to mark the boundary of the site"

Coordinate system - populated with the chosen coordinate system, display either:

"WGS84 (World Geodetic System 1984)
Latitude and longitude" OR

"OSGB36 (National Grid)
Eastings and Northings"

Start and end points - populated with the start/end point coordinates, display either:

"<latitude>, <longitude>" OR

"<eastings>, <northings>"

Points 2..n - populated with a a row for each set of coordinates from point 2 to point n, based on how many sets of coordinates have been added. For each row, display either:

"<latitude>, <longitude>" OR

"<eastings>, <northings>"

Map view - the "Map view" row shown in the prototype will not be delivered as part of this story, it will be delivered as a separate ticket, subject to a spike for the map rendering

NOTE - this is the same summary card that has been implemented as part of https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-121

NOTE - the "Change" link shown in the prototype will not be delivered as part of this story, they will be delivered as a separate ticket
