# ML-390: FILE - Provide Activity Description for Single Uploaded Site

## User Story

**AS** an applicant  
**I WANT** to provide an activity description for a single uploaded site  
**SO THAT** I can inform MMO of what kind of activity will take place at the site

## Background

As part of the multiple sites work, it is necessary for the applicant to provide activity descriptions for each site they have uploaded for their notification. Previously, the user only had to provide a description for the notification as a whole.

In the case where there is only a single site in the uploaded file, we do not need to ask the user if the descriptions are the same for all sites; we just proceed straight to asking them for the description.

Note that the logic around re-using descriptions is slightly different for manually entered sites (circular sites and polygon sites) so that is covered under a separate story.

## Resources

## Out of Scope

Logic around for manually entered sites (circular sites and polygon sites) is covered under a separate story

This story does not cover the survey link and other links in the header

This story does not cover the links in the footer

## Screenshots

**Page layout showing:**

- Standard GOV.UK header with crown logo and "GOV.UK" branding in white text on blue background
- Blue service header containing "Get permission for marine work" as the service name
- Navigation area on the right side of the service header containing "Projects", "Defra account", and "Sign out" links
- Beta banner with light blue background stating "This is a new service. Help us improve it and give your feedback (opens in new tab)." with an underlined feedback link
- Back link (with left arrow) for navigation to return to the previous page
- "Worthing sea sample" displayed as the project name caption above the main heading in grey text
- "Activity description" as the main H1 heading in large, bold black text
- Guidance text explaining the activity description requirements: "Briefly describe what you'll do, how you'll do it, and why."
- Example text providing concrete guidance: "For example, 'Collect a 0.1 cubic metre seabed sample by day grab from a workboat for particle size analysis'."
- Large rectangular textarea field with black border, currently empty and ready for user input, sized appropriately for extended text entry
- "Continue" button with green background positioned below the textarea
- "Cancel" link in blue text positioned to the right of the Continue button
- Standard GOV.UK footer with copyright information and regulatory links

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1 - Display page

**GIVEN** I have successfully provided the activity dates for the single uploaded site (as per https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-389)  
**WHEN** I select the "Continue" button on the "Activity dates" page  
**THEN** I will be taken to the "Activity description" page

**NOTE** - this supersedes the temporary navigation logic defined in AC3 of https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-389

### AC2 - Page behaviour

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Activity description" page for a single uploaded site  
**WHEN** the page is loaded  
**THEN** the page appears and behaves as per the prototype:

- the project name will appear as the page caption
- the textbox is empty by default
- the validation will continue to apply as per https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-11

### AC3 - Continue

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Activity description" page for a single uploaded site  
**AND** I have provided a description which pass the validation on the page  
**WHEN** I select the "Continue" button  
**THEN** I will be taken to the "Review site details" page

### AC4 - Cancel

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Activity description" page for a single uploaded site  
**WHEN** I select the "Cancel" option  
**THEN** I am returned to the task list:

- the status of the task will not be updated
- any answers that I have provided so far will be discarded
- any file I have uploaded will be discarded

### AC5 - Back

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Activity description" page for a single uploaded site  
**WHEN** I select the "Back" option  
**THEN** I am taken to the previous page in the flow i.e. the "Activity dates" page  
**AND** my previous answer is defaulted into the page

## Standard Behaviour

**"Back" link** - when I select the "Back" link (if present), I will be returned to the page I was on immediately prior to the current page. Any changes I made on the current page will be discarded.

**"Cancel" link** - when I select the "Cancel" link (if present) I will be returned to the task list. Any changes I made on the current page will be discarded.

**Displaying validation errors** - if any validation errors are triggered, they will be displayed in standard GDS format i.e. [error summary](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-summary/) at the top of the page, and [error message](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-message/) against the specific item that triggered the error. The wording of error messages should be verified against the data dictionary.
