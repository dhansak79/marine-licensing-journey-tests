# ML-69: Choose File to Upload

## User Story

**AS** an applicant  
**I WANT** to chose which file type to upload  
**SO THAT** I can pick the correct type based on the file I have

## Background

There are a number of different ways that the user can provide their location/site details. Because of this, there are a series of initial 'routing' questions to get the user to the correct functionality to provide their site details. This story represents the start of the journey to provide site details via 'file upload'. The first part of that journey is determining which file type the user wished to upload.

## Resources

- Link to "Which type of file do you want to upload?" page in prototype MVP
- Link to data dictionary

## Out of scope

- Navigation to the next page in the flow will be covered by a separate story
- This story does not cover the survey link and other links in the header
- This story does not cover the links in the footer

## Questions and answers

TBC

## Screenshots

### Screenshot 1: User Journey Flow

This flow diagram illustrates the complete site location journey within the marine licensing application. The diagram shows how users progress from the task list through various site location options:

- Starting from the task list, users select "Site details"
- At the "How do you want to provide the site location?" page, users can choose between "Upload a file" or "Enter coordinates manually"
- When "Upload a file" is selected, users proceed to "Which type of file do you want to upload?" (highlighted in blue box - this story's focus)
- Two file type options are available: "Shapefile" and "KML"
- Each file type leads to its respective upload page ("Upload a Shapefile" or "Upload a KML file")
- All paths eventually converge to "Review site details" with summary information displayed
- The manual coordinate entry path is also shown with its various branches for completeness

### Screenshot 2: File Type Selection Page

This page displays the "Which type of file do you want to upload?" interface. The page shows:

- Standard GOV.UK header with "Get permission for a marine activity" service name and Beta banner
- Navigation breadcrumb with "Back" link
- "Hammersmith pontoon project" displayed as the page caption
- Main heading "Which type of file do you want to upload?"
- Expandable help section titled "Help with file types" (collapsed in this view)
- Two radio button options:
  1. "Shapefile"
  2. "KML"
- "Continue" button (green) and "Cancel" link positioned below the radio buttons
- Standard GOV.UK footer with copyright and regulatory information
