# ML-19: Enter Coordinate for Polygon Site

## User Story

**AS** an applicant  
**I WANT** to enter a list of coordinates  
**SO THAT** I can provide an accurate location for my project

## Background

This story provides the user with the ability to enter a list of coordinates for the location of their project. Initially, the user will only be able to define three points for their site (i.e. three sets of coordinates), but a later story order will allow the user to add more points to their site.

## Resources

- Link to "Enter multiple sets of coordinates to mark the boundary of the site" page in prototype MVP - WGS84 version
- Link to "Enter multiple sets of coordinates to mark the boundary of the site" page in prototype MVP - OSGB36 version
- Link to data dictionary
- [Guidance on latitude and longitude (WGS84)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_degrees)
- [Guidance on easting/northings (OSGB36)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordnance_Survey_National_Grid)
- [Grid reference finder](https://gridreferencefinder.com/#)

## Out of Scope

Navigation to the next page in the flow will be covered by a separate story

This story does not cover the survey and other links in the header

This story does not cover the links in the footer

The "Add another" button is out of scope for this story, and will not be displayed. This means that initially, the user will only be able to add three points to their site.

## Questions and Answers

## Screenshots

### Screenshot 1: User Journey Flow Diagram

This diagram shows the complete user journey for providing site location information within the marine licensing application. The flow illustrates how users can choose between different methods of providing site location details, with the highlighted section showing the path for entering multiple coordinates manually. The diagram shows the progression from task list through site location method selection, coordinate entry method choice, coordinate system selection, and finally to the coordinate entry pages for polygon sites.

### Screenshot 2: Latitude/longitude version (WGS84)

This page shows the coordinate entry interface when WGS84 coordinate system has been selected for polygon sites. The page displays:

- Project name "Hammersmith pontoon project" as the page caption
- Main heading "Enter multiple sets of coordinates to mark the boundary of the site"
- Guidance text: "Enter in the decimal degree format. For example, 55.019889 or -1.399500."
- Expandable help section titled "Help with latitude and longitude formats"
- Multiple coordinate entry sections:
  - "Start and end point" with latitude and longitude input fields
  - "Point 2" with latitude and longitude input fields
  - "Point 3" with latitude and longitude input fields
- "Add another point" button (greyed out as noted in scope limitations)
- "Continue" button (green) and "Cancel" link at the bottom
- Standard GOV.UK styling and footer elements

### Screenshot 3: Easting/northings version (OSGB36)

This page shows the coordinate entry interface when OSGB36 coordinate system has been selected for polygon sites. The page displays:

- Project name "Hammersmith pontoon project" as the page caption
- Main heading "Enter multiple sets of coordinates to mark the boundary of the site"
- Guidance text: "Eastings and northings should only include numbers. For example: 123456. 654321."
- Expandable help section titled "Help with eastings and northings formats"
- Multiple coordinate entry sections:
  - "Start and end point" with eastings and northings input fields
  - "Point 2" with eastings and northings input fields
  - "Point 3" with eastings and northings input fields
- "Add another point" button (greyed out as noted in scope limitations)
- "Continue" button (green) and "Cancel" link at the bottom
- Standard GOV.UK styling and footer elements

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1 - Display page

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Which coordinate system do you want to use?" page (see [ML-18: Choose Coordinate System](./ML-18.choose.coordinate.system.md))  
**AND** I have selected either coordinate system radio button  
**AND** I previously selected that I want to enter a list of coordinates (see [ML-17: Choose Circle or Coordinate List Entry](./ML-17.choose.circle.or.coordinate.list.entry.md))  
**WHEN** I select the "Continue" button  
**THEN** the "Enter multiple sets of coordinates to mark the boundary of the site" page is displayed:

- the page appears as per the prototype (content varies depending on which coordinate system was chosen in the previous step)
- the project name will appear as the page caption
- the page contains explanatory text which can be expanded/collapsed (content varies depending on which coordinate system was chosen in the previous step)
- the page is blank by default
- if I have previously provided information on this page then that data will be pre-populated

### AC2 - Validation (WGS84 coordinate system selected)

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Enter multiple sets of coordinates to mark the boundary of the site" page  
**AND** I selected the WGS84 coordinate system on the previous page  
**WHEN** I select the "Continue" button  
**THEN** the following mandatory field validation will be performed:

- if a latitude field is blank, error: "Enter the latitude of \<point\>"
- if a longitude field is blank, error: "Enter the longitude of \<point\>"
- If a latitude field contains a non-numeric character (other than '.' and '-'), error: "Latitude of \<point\> must be a number"
- If a longitude field contains a non-numeric character (other than '.' and '-'), error: "Longitude of \<point\> must be a number"
- If a latitude field is not between -90 and 90, error: "Latitude of \<point\> must be between -90 and 90"
- If a longitude field is not between -180 and 180, error: "Longitude of \<point\> must be between -180 and 180"
- If a latitude field doesn't contain exactly 6 decimal places, error: "Latitude of \<point\> must include 6 decimal places, like 55.019889"
- If a longitude field doesn't contain exactly 6 decimal places, error: "Longitude of \<point\> must include 6 decimal places, like -1.399500"

**AND** the \<point\> in the error message will be replaced with a reference to the point which failed the validation such as "point 3" or "start and end point"

**EXAMPLE** - "Latitude of point 3 must be a number" or "Enter the longitude of start and end point"

**NOTE** - this is the same validation as when defining the centre point of a circle (see [ML-35: Enter Centre Point of a Circle](./ML-35.enter.centre.point.of.a.circle.md))

**DESIGN DECISION** - Following team discussion, the error message for the start and end point should reference "start and end point" rather than "the start and end point" to maintain consistency with the validation patterns used elsewhere in the application.

### AC3 - Validation (OSGB36 coordinate system selected)

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Enter multiple sets of coordinates to mark the boundary of the site" page  
**AND** I selected the OSGB36 coordinate system on the previous page  
**WHEN** I select the "Continue" button  
**THEN** the following mandatory field validation will be performed:

- if an eastings field is blank, error: "Enter the eastings of \<point\>"
- if a northings field is blank, error: "Enter the northings of \<point\>"
- If an eastings field contains a non-numeric character (other than '.' and '-'), error: "Eastings of \<point\> must be a number"
- If a northings field contains a non-numeric character (other than '.' and '-'), error: "Northings of \<point\> must be a number"
- If an eastings field contains a negative number, error: "Eastings of \<point\> must be a positive 6-digit number, like 123456"
- If a northings field contains a negative number, error: "Northings of \<point\> must be a positive 6 or 7-digit number, like 123456"
- If an eastings field doesn't contain exactly 6 digits, error: "Eastings of \<point\> must be 6 digits"
- If a northings field doesn't contain either 6 or 7 digits, error: "Northings of \<point\> must be 6 or 7 digits"

**AND** the \<point\> in the error message will be replaced with a reference to the point which failed the validation such as "point 3" or "start and end point"

**EXAMPLE** - "Eastings of point 3 must be a number" or "Enter the northings of start and end point"

**NOTE** - this is the same validation as when defining the centre point of a circle (see [ML-35: Enter Centre Point of a Circle](./ML-35.enter.centre.point.of.a.circle.md))

### AC6 - Continue

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Enter multiple sets of coordinates to mark the boundary of the site" page  
**AND** I have provided coordinates which will pass the validation defined in the previous ACs  
**WHEN** I select the "Continue" button  
**THEN** I will remain on the same page (navigation to the next page will be covered by a separate story)  
**AND** the coordinates are saved to my notification

### AC7 - Cancel

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Enter multiple sets of coordinates to mark the boundary of the site" page  
**WHEN** I select the "Cancel" option  
**THEN** I am returned to the task list:

- the status of the task will not be updated
- the details of the site that I have provided so far will be discarded

### AC8 - Back

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Enter multiple sets of coordinates to mark the boundary of the site" page  
**WHEN** I select the "Back" option  
**THEN** I am taken to the previous page in the flow i.e. the "Which coordinate system do you want to use?" page (see [ML-18: Choose Coordinate System](./ML-18.choose.coordinate.system.md))

## Standard Behaviour

**"Back" link** - when I select the "Back" link (if present), I will be returned to the page I was on immediately prior to the current page. Any changes I made on the current page will be discarded.

**"Cancel" link** - when I select the "Cancel" link (if present) I will be returned to the task list. Any changes I made on the current page will be discarded.

**Displaying validation errors** - if any validation errors are triggered, they will be displayed in standard GDS format i.e. [error summary](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-summary/) at the top of the page, and [error message](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-message/) against the specific item that triggered the error. The wording of error messages should be verified against the data dictionary.
