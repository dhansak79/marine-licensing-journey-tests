# ML-100: Delete Draft Notification

## User Story

**AS** an applicant  
**I WANT** to delete a draft application  
**SO THAT** I can manage notifications that are no longer required

## Background

The dashboard provides a location for the user to view all of their notifications. This story provides an option to allow the user to delete draft notifications (i.e. those that have not yet been submitted). The user may wish to do this if they are no longer going ahead with their project.

## Resources

- Link to "Dashboard" in prototype MVP
- Link to "Delete project" page in prototype MVP

## Out of scope

This story does not cover the survey link and other links in the header

This story does not cover the links in the footer

## Questions and answers

- Beta banner with feedback link
- "Your projects" as the main H1 heading
- Projects table with the following columns:
  - **Name** - Project names (e.g. "Tower Bridge refurbishment", "Hammersmith pontoon construction")
  - **Type** - Shows "Exempt activity" for exemption notifications
  - **Reference** - Shows reference numbers for completed projects or "-" for drafts
  - **Status** - Shows project status ("In progress" for drafts, "Completed" for submitted)
  - **Actions** - Contains action links including "Continue" for in-progress projects and "Delete" for draft notifications
- For draft notifications, the Actions column displays both "Continue" and "Delete" links
- For completed notifications, the Actions column shows "View details" only
- Standard GOV.UK footer with licensing and regulatory information

### Screenshot 2: Delete Confirmation Page

**Page layout showing:**

- Standard GOV.UK header with "Get permission for marine work" service name
- Beta banner with feedback link
- Back link for navigation
- "Are you sure you want to delete this project?" as the main H1 heading
- Project name displayed in the body text (e.g. "Tower Bridge refurbishment" or "Hammersmith pontoon construction")
- Two action buttons:
  - "Yes, delete project" button (red/warning style)
