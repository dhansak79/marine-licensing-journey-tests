# ML-83 - Change links on check your answers

## User Story

AS an applicant

I WANT to be able to make changes to the answers I have provided

SO THAT I can check everything is correct before I submit my notification

## Background

Currently, when the user is checking the information they have provided on the "Check your answers" page, they cannot make any changes. This story covers the ability to make changes to the user's answers directly from the "Check your answers" page.

It is worth noting that this behaviour applies across notifications for both manual entry and file uploaded sites.

## Resources

## Out of scope

This story does not cover the submission of the notification

This story does not cover any additional validation required at the point of submission, such as checking that the dates are still valid

## Questions and answers

Q. What do we do about the "Providing the site location" section? as per https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-694, we are removing the change links from that summery card on the "Review site details" page, and instead giving users the ability to delete all sites and start again. What do we do on the "Check your answers" page (since we don't want to delete all sites from here).

A. Tom has confirmed that the change link should remain, since the user will be able to carry out the change from the "Review site details" page (although they will have to delete their sites first).

**Description:** The "Check your answers before sending your information" page displays a comprehensive summary of all information provided by the applicant, organised into summary cards:

1. **Project summary card** - Shows project name ("South coast sea samples"), type of activity ("Removal of a substance or object"), the purpose of the activity ("Samples and data collection"), why the activity is exempt (based on marine licence Article 17A check), and a downloadable PDF of answers. Each row has a "Change" link on the right.

2. **Providing the site location card** - Shows the method of providing site location ("Enter the coordinates of the site manually") and whether there is more than one site ("Yes"). Each row has a "Change" link.

3. **Activity details card** - Shows whether activity dates are the same for every site ("Yes"), the activity dates ("22 November 2025 to 24 November 2025"), whether the activity description is the same for every site ("Yes"), and the activity description (detailed text about collecting seabed samples). Each row has a "Change" link.

4. **Site 1 details card** - Shows site name ("Barryshingles pier samples"), single or multiple sets of coordinates ("Enter one set of coordinates and a width to create a circular site"), coordinate system ("WGS84 (World Geodetic System 1984) Latitude and longitude"), coordinates at centre of site, width of circular site ("40 metres"), and a map view showing the circular site location. Each row (except the map) has a "Change" link.

5. **Site 2 details card** - Shows site name ("Huntingdon Cove samples"), single or multiple sets of coordinates ("Enter multiple sets of coordinates to mark the boundary of the site"), coordinate system ("WGS84 (World Geodetic System 1984) Latitude and longitude"), start and end points (three coordinate pairs), and a map view showing the triangular polygon site. Each row (except the map) has a "Change" link.

6. **Sharing your information publicly card** - Shows consent to publish information ("No") and why consent is not given (detailed explanation about commercially sensitive information). Each row has a "Change" link.

At the bottom of the page is a "Now send your information" section with explanatory text and a green "Confirm and send" button.
