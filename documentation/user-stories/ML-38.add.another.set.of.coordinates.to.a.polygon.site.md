# ML-38: Add Another Set of Coordinates to a Polygon Site

## User Story

**AS** an applicant  
**I WANT** to be able to add more sets of coordinates to my site  
**SO THAT** I can provide an accurate and detailed location for my site

## Background

The initial behaviour for the page where the user manually adds a list of coordinates (see ML-19) is limited to a set of three coordinates. The functionality in this story expands that behaviour to allow for more points to be added as necessary.

NOTE - The behaviour defined in this story is based on the MOJ "Add another" component (see the references section) and applies when the user has Javascript switched ON in their browser since the component relies on JavaScript. When JavaScript is not available, the page should reload with the additional form elements if the "Add another" button is pressed.

## Resources

- Link to "Enter multiple sets of coordinates to mark the boundary of the site" page in prototype MVP - WGS84 version
- Link to "Enter multiple sets of coordinates to mark the boundary of the site" page in prototype MVP - OSGB36 version
- MOJ design system "Add another" component: https://design-patterns.service.justice.gov.uk/components/add-another/

## Out of Scope

This story does not cover any behaviour on the page other than that which is directly related to the adding and removing of additional points; the rest of the behaviour of the page is defined in https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-19. For example, the behaviour of the "Back" option is not defined as it is unchanged from that story.

This story does not cover the survey and other links in the header

This story does not cover the links in the footer

## Questions and Answers

**Q.** What does the non-JS behaviour look like?  
**A.** As per the MOJ component that we are going to be using, if JavaScript is not available, the page should reload with the additional form elements if the "Add another" button is pressed.

**Q.** What if the user adds an additional point, and then doesn't populate it? Do we just ignore it, or would that point fail validation?  
**A.** Tom Mearns has confirmed that the blank additional point should fail validation, the same as any other point; it would not just be ignored. The user would have to populate it or remove it.

## Screenshots

### Screenshot 1: User Journey Flow Diagram

This diagram shows the complete user journey for providing site location information within the marine licensing application. The flow illustrates the progression from task list through site location method selection, coordinate entry method choice, coordinate system selection, and the coordinate entry pages for polygon sites. The highlighted section shows the path for entering multiple coordinates manually, with the "Enter multiple sets of coordinates to mark the boundary of the site" page (focus of this story) positioned in the flow between coordinate system selection and site details review.

### Screenshot 2: Initial State - Three Coordinate Points (OSGB36)

This page shows the initial coordinate entry interface when OSGB36 coordinate system has been selected for polygon sites. The page displays:

- Project name "Hammersmith pontoon project" as the page caption
- Main heading "Enter multiple sets of coordinates to mark the boundary of the site"
- Guidance text: "Eastings and northings should only include numbers. For example: 123456, 654321."
- Expandable help section titled "Help with eastings and northings formats"
- Three coordinate entry sections:
  - "Start and end point" with eastings and northings input fields
  - "Point 2" with eastings and northings input fields
  - "Point 3" with eastings and northings input fields
- "Add another point" button positioned below the coordinate fields
- "Continue" button (green) and "Cancel" link at the bottom
- Standard GOV.UK styling and footer elements

### Screenshot 3: After Adding Point 4 (OSGB36)

This page shows the coordinate entry interface after the user has clicked "Add another point" to add a fourth coordinate point. The page displays:

- Same project context and guidance as the initial state
- Four coordinate entry sections:
  - "Start and end point" with eastings and northings input fields
  - "Point 2" with eastings and northings input fields
  - "Point 3" with eastings and northings input fields
  - "Point 4" with eastings and northings input fields and a "Remove" button
- "Add another point" button positioned below all coordinate fields
- "Continue" button (green) and "Cancel" link at the bottom
- The "Remove" button allows users to delete the newly added coordinate point

### Screenshot 4: WGS84 Coordinate System Version

This page shows the coordinate entry interface when WGS84 coordinate system has been selected for polygon sites. The page displays:

- Project name "Hammersmith pontoon project" as the page caption
- Main heading "Enter multiple sets of coordinates to mark the boundary of the site"
- Guidance text: "Enter in the decimal degree format. For example, 55.019889 or -1.399500."
- Expandable help section titled "Help with latitude and longitude formats"
- Three coordinate entry sections:
  - "Start and end point" with latitude and longitude input fields
  - "Point 2" with latitude and longitude input fields
  - "Point 3" with latitude and longitude input fields
- "Add another point" button positioned below the coordinate fields
- "Continue" button (green) and "Cancel" link at the bottom
- Standard GOV.UK styling and footer elements

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1 - Display "Add another point" button

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Enter multiple sets of coordinates to mark the boundary of the site" page (see https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-19)  
**WHEN** the page is loaded  
**THEN** a new "Add another point" button is displayed at the bottom of the page after the existing sets of coordinate fields

**NOTE** - this covers both WGS84 and OSGB36 coordinate system scenarios

### AC2 - Press "Add another point" button

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Enter multiple sets of coordinates to mark the boundary of the site" page (see https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-19)  
**AND** I have Javascript enabled on my browser  
**WHEN** I press the "Add another point" button  
**THEN** a new heading, set of coordinate fields and "Remove" button are added to the bottom of the list of coordinate sets:

- the new controls will appear as per the prototype
- the coordinate fields will be labelled as either latitude/longitude or eastings/northings depending on the coordinate system previously chosen
- the subheading and coordinate fields will have an incremental number
- the coordinate fields will be blank by default
- there is no limit to the number of additional points I can add (we should investigate what a reasonable limit might be, and we can implement a limit if required under a separate ticket)

### AC3 - Press "Remove" button

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Enter multiple sets of coordinates to mark the boundary of the site" page (see https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-19)  
**AND** I have Javascript enabled on my browser  
**WHEN** I press the "Remove" button against a set of coordinates  
**THEN** the heading, "Remove" button and coordinate fields associated with the "Remove" button will be removed from the page  
**AND** any coordinate data entered in the removed fields will be discarded; it will not be retained  
**AND** if necessary, any remaining coordinate sets will be re-numbered such that the numbering remains sequential without any gaps

**EXAMPLE** - if I add three new sets of coordinates, they will be labelled as points 4, 5 and 6. If I remove point 4, then points 5 and 6 will be relabelled as points 4 and 5 respectively. This will ensure that the numbering is sequential without any gaps.

### AC4 - Non-JS behaviour

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Enter multiple sets of coordinates to mark the boundary of the site" page (see https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-19)  
**AND** I have Javascript disabled on my browser  
**WHEN** I use the buttons defined in the previous ACs to add or remove coordinates  
**THEN** the page is reloaded in order for the changes to be applied

### AC5 - Validation (WGS84 coordinate system selected)

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Enter multiple sets of coordinates to mark the boundary of the site" page  
**AND** I selected the WGS84 coordinate system on the previous page  
**WHEN** I select the "Continue" button  
**THEN** the following mandatory field validation will be performed:

- if a latitude field is blank, error: "Enter the latitude of \<point\>"
- if a longitude field is blank, error: "Enter the longitude of \<point\>"
- If a latitude field contains a non-numeric character (other than '.' and '-'), error: "Latitude of \<point\> must be a number"
- If a longitude field contains a non-numeric character (other than '.' and '-'), error: "Longitude of \<point\> must be a number"
- If a latitude field is not between -90 and 90, error: "Latitude of \<point\> must be between -90 and 90"
- If a longitude field is not between -180 and 180, error: "Longitude of \<point\> must be between -180 and 180"
- If a latitude field doesn't contain exactly 6 decimal places, error: "Latitude of \<point\> must include 6 decimal places, like 55.019889"
- If a longitude field doesn't contain exactly 6 decimal places, error: "Longitude of \<point\> must include 6 decimal places, like -1.399500"

**AND** the \<point\> in the error message will be replaced with a reference to the point which failed the validation such as "point 4" or "point 6"

**EXAMPLE** - "Latitude of point 4 must be a number" or "Enter the longitude of point 6"

**NOTE** - this is the same validation as the first three coordinates on the page (see https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-19), it is just being extended to cover the additional points that can now be added by the user. This validation applies regardless of whether Javascript is switched ON or OFF.

### AC6 - Validation (OSGB36 coordinate system selected)

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Enter multiple sets of coordinates to mark the boundary of the site" page  
**AND** I selected the OSGB36 coordinate system on the previous page  
**WHEN** I select the "Continue" button  
**THEN** the following mandatory field validation will be performed:

- if an eastings field is blank, error: "Enter the eastings of \<point\>"
- if a northings field is blank, error: "Enter the northings of \<point\>"
- If an eastings field contains a non-numeric character (other than '.' and '-'), error: "Eastings of \<point\> must be a number"
- If a northings field contains a non-numeric character (other than '.' and '-'), error: "Northings of \<point\> must be a number"
- If an eastings field contains a negative number, error: "Eastings of \<point\> must be a positive 6-digit number, like 123456"
- If a northings field contains a negative number, error: "Northings of \<point\> must be a positive 6 or 7-digit number, like 123456"
- If an eastings field doesn't contain exactly 6 digits, error: "Eastings of \<point\> must be 6 digits"
- If a northings field doesn't contain either 6 or 7 digits, error: "Northings of \<point\> must be 6 or 7 digits"

**AND** the \<point\> in the error message will be replaced with a reference to the point which failed the validation such as "point 4" or "point 6"

**EXAMPLE** - "Eastings of point 4 must be a number" or "Enter the northings of point 6"

**NOTE** - this is the same validation as the first three coordinates on the page (see https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-19), it is just being extended to cover the additional points that can now be added by the user. This validation applies regardless of whether Javascript is switched ON or OFF.

### AC7 - Continue

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Enter multiple sets of coordinates to mark the boundary of the site" page  
**AND** I have provided coordinates which will pass the validation defined in the previous ACs  
**WHEN** I select the "Continue" button  
**THEN** the additional points are saved to my notification as per the initial three points for the site (delivered under https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-19)  
**AND** IF https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-121 has been implemented I will be taken to the "Review site details" page  
**AND** IF https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-121 has NOT been implemented I will remain on the same page

### AC8 - Cancel

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Enter multiple sets of coordinates to mark the boundary of the site" page  
**WHEN** I select the "Cancel" option  
**THEN** the "Cancel" behaviour defined in https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-19 will apply  
**AND** any additional points that I have added using functionality in this story will be discarded as expected

## Standard Behaviour

**"Back" link** - when I select the "Back" link (if present), I will be returned to the page I was on immediately prior to the current page. Any changes I made on the current page will be discarded.

**"Cancel" link** - when I select the "Cancel" link (if present) I will be returned to the task list. Any changes I made on the current page will be discarded.

**Displaying validation errors** - if any validation errors are triggered, they will be displayed in standard GDS format i.e. [error summary](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-summary/) at the top of the page, and [error message](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-message/) against the specific item that triggered the error. The wording of error messages should be verified against the data dictionary.
