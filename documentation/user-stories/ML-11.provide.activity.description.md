# ML-11: Provide Activity Description

## User Story

**AS** an applicant  
**I WANT** to provide a description of the activity that I will be undertaking  
**SO THAT** I can ensure that MMO understands the activity that will be covered by the exemption

## Background

The activity description gives the applicant the opportunity to tell MMO a bit more about their planned activity.

## Resources

- Link to "Activity description" page in prototype MVP
- Link to data dictionary

## Out of Scope

This story does not cover the link for the survey in the header.

This story does not cover the links in the footer.

## Questions and Answers

**Q.** How much text should we allow in the activity description text field?

**A.** Current MCMS behaviour allows 4000 characters for the "Project Background" field

## Screenshots

**Activity description page showing:**

- "Activity description" as H1 heading
- Project name displayed as page caption (e.g. "Hammersmith pontoon construction")
- Helper text: "Provide details about what you plan to do at this location"
- Large textarea field for activity description input
- Character count indicator showing remaining characters
- "Save and continue" button
- "Cancel" link
- Standard GOV.UK page layout with Beta banner

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1 - Display "Activity description" page

**GIVEN** I am viewing the task list (see [ML-9: View the task list](./ML-9.view.the.task.list.md))

**WHEN** I select the "Activity description" task

**THEN** the "Activity description" page is displayed:

- the page will appear as per the prototype
- the project name will appear as the page caption
- the textbox will be blank initially
- if I have previously provided information on this page then that data will be pre-populated

### AC2 - Validate the activity description

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Activity description" page

**WHEN** I select the "Save and continue" button

**THEN** the following validation will be performed:

- **Mandatory field** - if I have not provided any text, display the following error: "Enter the activity description"
- **Maximum length of text** - if I have provided text which is greater than 4000 characters, display the following error: "Activity description must be 4000 characters or less"

### AC3 - Save the activity description

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Activity description" page

**WHEN** I select the "Save and continue" button  
**AND** all the validation in the previous AC is passed

**THEN** the activity description will be saved  
**AND** I will be returned to the task list  
**AND** the "Activity description" task will be marked as "Completed"

### AC4 - "Cancel" option / "Back" link

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Activity description" page

**WHEN** I select the "Cancel" option or the "Back" link

**THEN** I am returned to the task list:

- the status of the task will not be updated
- any changes I have made on the page during this visit are not saved

## Standard Behaviour

**"Back" link** - when I select the "Back" link (if present), I will be returned to the page I was on immediately prior to the current page. Any changes I made on the current page will be discarded.

**"Cancel" link** - when I select the "Cancel" link (if present) I will be returned to the task list. Any changes I made on the current page will be discarded.

**Displaying validation errors** - if any validation errors are triggered, they will be displayed in standard GDS format i.e. [error summary](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-summary/) at the top of the page, and [error message](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-message/) against the specific item that triggered the error. The wording of error messages should be verified against the data dictionary.
