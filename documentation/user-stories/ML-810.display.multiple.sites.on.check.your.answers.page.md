# ML-810 - Display multiple sites on the "Check your answers" page

AS an applicant

I WANT to see details of all the sites I have added to my exemption notification

SO THAT I can ensure that all my data is correct before I submit

## Background

Once the multiple sites tickets functionality has been implemented, there are a number of changes required to the "Check your answers" page, to ensure that all the relevant site information is displayed correctly.

This story makes the necessary changes to the summary cards on the "Check your answers" page, for both file upload and manual entry exemptions. The changes include removing certain summary cards, updating summary cards and adding new summary cards. The changes will be applied to botht he "Check your answers" page and the "View details" page, since both effectively display the same information.

## Out of scope

Change links are out of scope for this story

There are no changes to the "Public register" summary card as part of this story
