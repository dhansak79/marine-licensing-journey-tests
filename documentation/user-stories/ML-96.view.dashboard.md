# ML-96: View Dashboard

## User Story

**AS** an applicant  
**I WANT** to see a list of all my applications  
**SO THAT** I can keep track of my applications and manage them

## Background

The dashboard is the central hub of the user's experience, listing all their notifications (plus other types of applications in future as we build them) and allowing users to manage them. The dashboard page shows a list of notifications with a default sort order showing draft applications first, followed by completed applications sorted by project name alphabetically.

## Resources

- Link to "Dashboard" prototype MVP
- Link to "Dashboard (empty state)" prototype MVP

## Out of Scope

This story does not cover:

- The ability to sort the dashboard manually
- "Continue", "Delete" and "View details" actions
- The survey link and other links in the header
- The links in the footer

## Questions and Answers

**Q.** What should the default sort order for the dashboard be? Should drafts always be at the top?  
**A.** Sort order confirmed with Tom Mearns, dashboard should initially be sorted by status

**Q.** During refinement, an additional question was raised about sort order. The suggestion was that it would make more sense to initially sort with the newest first, rather than oldest first. That way, your most recent/current work will be at the top.  
**A.** I think this is an error/typo on my part, since I don't have any record of this decision in conversations with Tom Mearns. I have updated it to reflect the newest being at the top. NOTE initial sort order has been updated following discussion 23/6.

**Q.** Can the dashboard changes from multiples sites prototype v2 be backported into the MVP prototype? The changes (new wording for statuses and a new 'created date/time' column) are not specific to multiple sites, and would potentially be beneficial for the MVP journey (since users found the status wording confusing)  
**A.** Yes - prototype to be updated as per discussion with Tom 23/6

## Screenshots

### Dashboard with Projects

Dashboard with multiple projects showing a table with Name, Type, Reference, Status, Date submitted, and Actions columns. The table displays projects with different statuses: "Draft" status applications appear first, followed by "Closed" applications with reference numbers (EXE/2025/XXXXX format) and submission dates. Each row shows appropriate status information and maintains proper sorting order.

### Empty State Dashboard

Dashboard empty state showing "Your projects" heading followed by the message "You currently have no projects." The page maintains the same header structure with "Get permission for a marine activity" service name and navigation links.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1 - Display Dashboard

**GIVEN** I am viewing any page within the service  
**WHEN** I select the "Projects home" link in the header  
**THEN** I am taken to the projects dashboard  
**AND** the page will appear as per the prototype  
**AND** the page will contain a list of my projects as per the following ACs

### AC2 - Dashboard Content

**GIVEN** I am viewing the dashboard  
**AND** I have created at least one notification  
**WHEN** I look at the table of projects (NOTE - maximum table width as per prototype is 1280px)  
**THEN** I see the following information:

- **Name** - populated with the "Project name" field
- **Type** - populated with fixed text "Exempt activity" (this will vary as we add different types of application such as marine licences later)
- **Reference** - populated with the unique reference number for the notification (see https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-21). This column will contain "-" if the notification has not yet been submitted (since the reference number is only generated at the point of submission)
- **Status** - populated with the status of the notification:
  - "Draft" - for notifications that have not yet been submitted
  - "Closed" - for notifications that have been submitted
- **Date submitted** - populated with the date that the notification was submitted. This column will contain "-" if the notification has not yet been submitted
- **Actions** - not covered by this story

**NOTE** - Initially for notifications, we will not query Dynamics to check the status of submitted notifications. Since we know that any submitted notifications will automatically be closed by Dynamics, we do not need to check the status. Anything unsubmitted will be "Draft", anything submitted will be "Closed".

### AC3 - Dashboard Content (Empty State)

**GIVEN** I am viewing the dashboard  
**AND** I have not created any notifications  
**WHEN** I view the dashboard  
**THEN** I see the 'empty state' version of the dashboard (see prototype)

### AC4 - Sort Order

**GIVEN** I am viewing the dashboard  
**WHEN** I view the list of notifications  
**THEN** I see that the notifications are sorted by status with drafts first followed by "closed" records, and then within each of those statuses sort by project name (from A-Z)  
**AND** I am not able to change the sort order (this will be covered by a separate story)

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed Implementation

- **Complete dashboard functionality** - Full view dashboard implementation displaying all user exemptions
- **Multi-status display** - Correctly displays both Draft and Closed exemption notifications
- **Proper sorting implementation** - Draft notifications appear first, followed by Closed notifications sorted by project name A-Z
- **Empty state handling** - Displays appropriate empty state message when no notifications exist
- **Reference number display** - Shows application reference numbers (EXE/2025/XXXXX format) for submitted notifications
- **Date formatting** - Displays submission dates for completed exemptions
- **Complete test automation** - 3 comprehensive BDD scenarios with full coverage

### Technical Implementation Details

1. **Dashboard Page Object**: Complete page object with table selectors and content verification
2. **Screenplay Pattern**:
   - `NavigateToDashboard` task for accessing dashboard
   - `EnsureDashboardDisplaysNotification` for single notification verification
   - `EnsureDashboardSortOrder` for multi-notification sort verification
   - `EnsureEmptyStateMessage` for empty state validation
3. **Memory Management**: Robust separation of active vs completed exemptions to prevent test conflicts
4. **Authentication Flow**: Complete sign-out/sign-in cycle for multi-exemption testing

### Test Coverage

**✅ Dashboard Scenarios (3/3 complete)**:

1. **Submit exemption and view on dashboard** - Single notification display verification
2. **View empty dashboard when no notifications exist** - Empty state message validation
3. **View dashboard with multiple notifications in correct sort order** - Multi-exemption sorting verification including both completed and partial exemptions

### Integration Points

- **Project Name (ML-1)**: Dashboard displays project names from exemption creation
- **Submit Notification (ML-84)**: Dashboard shows submitted exemptions with reference numbers
- **Application Reference (ML-21)**: Dashboard displays generated reference numbers correctly
- **Authentication System**: Complete integration with sign-out/sign-in workflows
- **Task Management**: Dashboard reflects exemption completion status accurately

**Priority:** Complete - Full dashboard functionality implemented and tested with comprehensive scenarios covering all acceptance criteria and edge cases including multiple exemption workflows and authentication state management.
