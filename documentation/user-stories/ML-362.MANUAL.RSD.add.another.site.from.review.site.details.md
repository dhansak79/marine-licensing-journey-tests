# ML-362: MANUAL - RSD - Add Another Site from Review Site Details

## User Story

**AS** an applicant  
**I WANT** to click an "Add another site" button on the "Review site details" page  
**SO THAT** I can efficiently add multiple sites without being asked for information I've already provided that applies to all sites.

## Background

Building on the site name, dates, description and "Review site details" page changes (see ML-228, ML-419, ML-420, ML-114, ML-421 and ML-361), this story will add the "Add another site" button when reviewing sites provided by manual entry.

When the "Add another site" button is clicked, the user will be taken back to the start of the journey to manually add a site -

First, they will be asked for the site name

Next, they will be asked about the site dates IF they previously indicated that the dates for each site are different. If they indicated that the dates are all the same, then this step is skipped (since we know the dates for the site already). This is the first decision point in the highlighted section of the flow.

Next, they will be asked about the site description IF they previously indicated that the description for each site is different. If they indicated that the descriptions are all the same, then this step is skipped (since we know the description for the site already). This is the second decision point in the highlighted section of the flow.

Next they will go on to the existing page where we ask how they want to provide the coordinates (circle or polygon page). They then continue with the existing flow, all the way through to the "Review site details page. From there, they could add another new site, and so on and so on back through the loop multiple times.

This story is all about simplifying the flow for the user once they have been through the process off adding their first site. On subsequent loops through, we only ask about the dates and description for the site if we need to; we skip them if we already have that information.

Since we've already covered the detailed behaviour of the name, dates and description logic in the stories listed above, we don't need to cover behaviour in detail here; this story is really about saying how much of the stuff from those stories can the user skip out, and under what circumstances.

## Standard Behaviour

**"Back" link** - when I select the "Back" link (if present), I will be returned to the page I was on immediately prior to the current page. Any changes I made on the current page will be discarded.

**"Cancel" link** - when I select the "Cancel" link (if present) I will be returned to the task list. Any changes I made on the current page will be discarded.

**"Add another site" button** - when I select the "Add another site" button, I will be taken to the site name entry page to begin adding an additional site, with conditional routing based on my previous choices about dates and descriptions.

**Displaying validation errors** - if any validation errors are triggered, they will be displayed in standard GDS format i.e. [error summary](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-summary/) at the top of the page, and [error message](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-message/) against the specific item that triggered the error. The wording of error messages should be verified against the data dictionary.
