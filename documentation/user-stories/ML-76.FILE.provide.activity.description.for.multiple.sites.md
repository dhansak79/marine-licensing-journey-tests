# ML-76: FILE - Provide Activity Description for Multiple Sites

## User Story

**AS** an applicant  
**I WANT** to re-use the same activity description for all my uploaded sites where appropriate  
**SO THAT** I do not have to keep re-entering the same description

## Background

As part of the multiple sites work, it is necessary for the applicant to provide a description for each site they have uploaded for their notification. Previously, the user only had to provide a description for the notification as a whole.

In reality, where the uploaded file contains multiple sites, the description will frequently be the same for all sites, so the service will ask the user if they wish to re-use the same description for all of their sites.

Note that the logic around re-using descriptions for manually entered sites (circular sites and polygon sites) is slightly different, so that is covered under a separate story.

## Resources

## Out of Scope

Logic around re-using a description for manually entered sites (circular sites and polygon sites) is covered under a separate story

Navigation to the next page in the flow will be covered by a separate story

This story does not cover the survey link and other links in the header

- Back link (with left arrow) for navigation to return to the previous page
- "South coast sea samples" displayed as the project name caption above the main heading in grey text
- "Activity description" as the main H1 heading in large, bold black text
- Guidance paragraph text: "Briefly describe what you'll do at all sites, how you'll do it, and why."
- Example paragraph text: "For example, 'Collect a 0.1 cubic metre seabed sample by day grab from a workboat for particle size analysis'."
- Large rectangular textarea field with black border, currently empty and ready for user input
- "Continue" button with green background positioned below the textarea
- "Cancel" link in blue text positioned to the right of the Continue button

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1 - Display page

**GIVEN** I have successfully uploaded my coordinate file  
**AND** I indicated that all my sites have the same activity description (see https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-120)  
**WHEN** I select the "Continue" button on the "Is the activity description the same for every site?" page  
**THEN** I will be taken to the "Activity description" page to enter the description for the sites

**NOTE** - if I indicated that my sites have different activity descriptions then I will not see this page

**NOTE** - if there is only one site in the uploaded file then I will not see this page

### AC2 - Page behaviour

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Activity description" page (as per the previous AC)  
**WHEN** the page is loaded  
**THEN** the page appears and behaves as per the prototype:

- the project name will appear as the page caption
- the textbox will be blank by default
- the page will have the following minor changes from the page built for https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-11:
  - The paragraph text has changed/expanded (and is formatted as paragraph text rather than hint text)
  - Call to action is "Continue" rather than "Save and continue"
- the field-level validation will continue to apply as per https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-11

**NOTE** - this page has already been built under and is currently being accessed directly from the task list at a 'notification' level. We are re-using the same page, with the same validation, but with the description being specific to the site. There are minor changes to the content on the page, but the behaviour is the same

### AC3 - Continue

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Activity description" page (as per previous ACs)  
**AND** I have provided a description which pass the validation on the page  
**WHEN** I select the "Continue" button  
**THEN** I will remain on the same page (navigating to the next page will be covered in another story)

### AC4 - Cancel

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Activity description" page (as per previous ACs)  
**WHEN** I select the "Cancel" option  
**THEN** I am returned to the task list:

- the status of the task will not be updated
- any answers that I have provided so far will be discarded
- any file I have uploaded will be discarded

### AC5 - Back

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Activity description" page (as per previous ACs)  
**WHEN** I select the "Back" option  
**THEN** I am taken to the previous page in the flow i.e. the "Are the activity descriptions the same for every site?" page  
**AND** my previous answer is defaulted into the page

## Standard Behaviour

**"Back" link** - when I select the "Back" link (if present), I will be returned to the page I was on immediately prior to the current page. Any changes I made on the current page will be discarded.

**"Cancel" link** - when I select the "Cancel" link (if present) I will be returned to the task list. Any changes I made on the current page will be discarded.

**Displaying validation errors** - if any validation errors are triggered, they will be displayed in standard GDS format i.e. [error summary](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-summary/) at the top of the page, and [error message](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-message/) against the specific item that triggered the error. The wording of error messages should be verified against the data dictionary.
