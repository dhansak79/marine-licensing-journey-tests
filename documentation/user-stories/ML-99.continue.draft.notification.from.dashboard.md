### Screenshot 1: Dashboard with Draft Notifications

**Dashboard page showing:**

- Standard GOV.UK header with "Get permission for a marine activity" service name
- Beta banner indicating "This is a new service. Help us improve it and give your feedback (opens in new tab)."
- Navigation links in header: "Projects home", "Defra account", "Sign out"
- "Your projects" as the main H1 heading
- Project table with columns:
  - **Name** - showing project names like "Tower Bridge refurbishment", "Hammersmith pontoon construction"
  - **Type** - displaying "Exempt activity" for all projects
  - **Reference** - showing reference numbers for completed projects (e.g., "EXE/2025/00001") or "-" for drafts
  - **Status** - displaying status indicators:
    - "In progress" (blue text) for draft notifications
    - "Completed" (green background) for submitted notifications
  - **Actions** - containing action links:
    - "Continue" links for draft notifications with "In progress" status
    - "View details" links for completed notifications
- Multiple projects displayed showing different statuses and corresponding actions
- Standard GOV.UK footer with licensing and regulatory information

**Key Elements:**

- Draft notifications clearly identified by "In progress" status

- Clear visual distinction between draft and completed notifications
- Consistent table layout following GOV.UK design patterns
