# ML-543: Update Service Name and GOV.UK Frontend

## User Story

**AS** a user of the marine licensing service  
**I WANT** to see the correct service name "Get permission for marine work" displayed consistently throughout the application  
**SO THAT** I have a clear understanding of what service I am using

## Background

The marine licensing service needs to display the agreed service name "Get permission for marine work" rather than the previous name "Apply for a marine licence".

## Dashboard Screenshot Description

The screenshot shows the GOV.UK marine licensing service dashboard page displaying the correct service name implementation:

- **Header Navigation**: Shows "Get permission for marine work" as the primary service name in the top navigation area, along with "Projects home" and "Sign out" links
- **Beta Banner**: Displays the standard GOV.UK beta service banner indicating that this is a new service with a feedback link
- **Page Content**: Shows the "Your projects" dashboard with a data table containing columns for Name, Type, Reference, Status, Date submitted, and Actions
- **Project Entry**: Contains one draft project entry ("fdsfdsfd") classified as an "Exempt activity" with a "Continue" action link
- **Consistent Branding**: The GOV.UK crown logo and blue header styling follow standard government service design patterns

This screenshot demonstrates successful implementation of the agreed service name "Get permission for marine work" in the user interface, replacing any previous references to "Apply for a marine licence".

## Task List Screenshot Description

The screenshot shows the GOV.UK marine licensing service task list page displaying the correct service name implementation:

- **Header Navigation**: Consistently shows "Get permission for marine work" as the primary service name in the top navigation, maintaining branding continuity from the dashboard
- **Beta Banner**: Maintains the standard GOV.UK beta service banner with feedback link across all pages
- **Page Title**: Shows "Exempt activity" followed by the project name as the main heading
- **Guidance Text**: Provides clear instructions about completing sections before submission and the ability to make changes after completion
- **Task List Structure**: Displays a well-organized task list with the following sections:
  - Project name (Completed)
  - Activity dates (Incomplete)
  - Activity description (Incomplete)
  - Site details (Incomplete)
  - Public register (Incomplete)
- **Status Indicators**: Uses clear "Completed" and "Incomplete" status tags to guide users through the application process
- **Footer**: Includes standard GOV.UK footer with Privacy, Cookies, Accessibility statement links, Open Government Licence information, and Crown copyright

This screenshot further confirms consistent implementation of the agreed service name "Get permission for marine work" throughout the application journey, from dashboard through to detailed task completion pages.
