# ML-420: MANUAL Provide Activity Dates

## User Story

**AS** an applicant  
**I WANT** to re-use the same set of activity dates for all my manually entry sites where appropriate  
**SO THAT** I do not have to keep re-entering the same dates

## Background

As part of the multiple sites work, it is necessary for the applicant to provide activity dates for each site they are manually inputting for their exemption notification. Previously, the user only had to provide dates for the exemption notification as a whole.

In reality, the dates will frequently be the same for all sites. In this case, the service will ask the user if they wish to re-use the same set of dates for all of their sites.

Note that the logic around re-using dates is slightly different for uploaded sites, which is covered in https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-75

## Workflow Position

## Resources

- Link to "the dates are the same for every site" prototype page
- Link to "at least once site has different dates" prototype page
- Workflow - essential for understanding why this page differs depending on if there are multiple dates or a single date.

## Out of Scope

- Logic around re-using dates for uploaded sites, which is covered in https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-75
- Navigation to the next page in the flow will be covered by a separate story
- This story does not cover the survey link and other links in the header
- This story does not cover the links in the footer

## Questions and Answers

TBC

## Screenshots

### Screenshot 1: Activity Dates Page - Same Dates for All Sites

**Page layout showing:**

- Standard GOV.UK header with "Get permission for marine work" service name
- Beta banner with feedback link indicating "This is a new service. Help us improve it and give your feedback (opens in new tab)."
- Back link for navigation to return to the previous page
- "Sea samples" displayed as the project name caption above the main heading
- "Activity dates" as the main H1 heading
- Guidance text explaining activity date requirements: "Enter the activity dates. Allow time for potential delays, like consents (for example, a river works licence) or bad weather. If you miss the dates, you'll need to restart the process."
- Additional guidance: "You can enter a start date from today and begin your activity as soon as you've sent your information."
- Start date section with:
  - "Start date" subheading
  - "For example, 27 5 2025" hint text
  - Three input fields for Day, Month, and Year
- End date section with:
  - "End date" subheading
  - "For example, 27 5 2025" hint text
  - Three input fields for Day, Month, and Year
- "Save and continue" button (green) and "Cancel" link positioned below the date inputs
- Standard GOV.UK footer with licensing and regulatory information

### Screenshot 2: Workflow Position Diagram

**Flow diagram showing:**

- Complete user journey flow for multiple site activity dates handling
- Multiple decision points and pathways including:
  - "Do you need to enter coordinates for more than one site?" with Yes/No options
  - "Enter activity dates" process box highlighted with "YOU ARE HERE" indicator
  - Various workflow branches for different scenarios
- Integration points with other ML tickets (ML-227, ML-228, ML-419, ML-420, etc.)
- Clear indication that the activity dates entry appears at a specific point in the multi-site workflow
- Visual representation of the conditional logic that determines when this page appears

### Screenshot 3: Activity Dates Page - Different Dates per Site

**Page layout showing:**

- Standard GOV.UK header with "Get permission for marine work" service name
- Beta banner with feedback link
- Back link for navigation
- "South coast sea samples" displayed as the project name caption
- "Site 1" displayed as an additional identifier above the main heading (indicating site-specific dates)
- "Activity dates" as the main H1 heading
- Same guidance text about activity dates and timing considerations as Screenshot 1
- Start date section with Day, Month, Year input fields and example "27 7 2026"
- End date section with Day, Month, Year input fields and example "27 8 2026"
- "Continue" button (green) and "Cancel" link positioned below the date inputs
- Standard GOV.UK footer

**Key difference:** The presence of "Site 1" identifier indicates this is the version shown when sites have different dates, requiring individual date entry per site.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1 - Display Page

**GIVEN** I have multiple sites to manually input  
**WHEN** I select the "Continue" button on the "Are the activity dates the same for every site?" page  
**THEN** I will be taken to the "Activity dates" page to enter the dates for the sites

### AC2 - Page Behaviour

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Activity dates" page  
**WHEN** the page is loaded  
**THEN** the page appears and behaves as as per the prototype:

- the project name will appear as the page caption
- neither date is populated by default
- the page text will be different from https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-10 as it will vary depending on if the sites have different dates or a single date - see the screenshots section above.
- the date validation will continue to apply as per https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-10
- the call to action is changed from "Save and continue" to "Continue"
- if the user has indicated that the sites have different dates, the site number e.g. "Site 1" will be displayed above the page heading (see prototype) - since the user is just entering the dates for that specific site. "Site 1" is not displayed if all sites will have the same dates - since in that scenario, the user is entering the dates for all sites.

**NOTE** - this page has already been built under and is currently being accessed directly from the task list at a 'notification' level. We are re-using the same page, with the same validation, but with the dates being specific to the site. There are minor changes to the content on the page as listed above, but the behaviour is the same

### AC3 - Continue

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Activity dates" page  
**AND** I have provided dates which pass the validation on the page  
**WHEN** I select the "Continue" button  
**THEN** I will remain on the same page (navigating to the next page will be covered in another story)

### AC4 - Cancel

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Activity dates" page as part of a manual input journey  
**WHEN** I select the "Cancel" option  
**THEN** I am returned to the task list  
**AND** the status of the task will not be updated  
**AND** any answers that I have provided so far will be discarded

### AC5 - Back

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Activity dates" page as part of a manual input journey  
**WHEN** I select the "Back" option  
**THEN** I am taken to the previous page in the flow i.e. the "Are the activity dates the same for every site?" page  
**AND** my previous answer is defaulted into the page

### AC6 - Invalid or No Dates

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Activity dates" page  
**AND** I have provided dates which fail validation (including empty date fields)  
**WHEN** I select the "Continue" button  
**THEN** validation errors are displayed as per https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-10

## Standard Behaviour

**"Back" link** - when I select the "Back" link (if present), I will be returned to the page I was on immediately prior to the current page. Any changes I made on the current page will be discarded.

**"Cancel" link** - when I select the "Cancel" link (if present) I will be returned to the task list. Any changes I made on the current page will be discarded.

**Displaying validation errors** - if any validation errors are triggered, they will be displayed in standard GDS format i.e. [error summary](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-summary/) at the top of the page, and [error message](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-message/) against the specific item that triggered the error. The wording of error messages should be verified against the data dictionary.
