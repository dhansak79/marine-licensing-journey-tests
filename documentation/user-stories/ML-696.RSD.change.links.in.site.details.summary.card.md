# ML-696: RSD - Change links in "Site details" summary card (file upload)

AS an applicant

I WANT to be able to change answers from the "Review site details" page

SO THAT I can ensure that my sites are correct

## Background

This story covers the ability to make changes to the answers given in the "Site details" summary card(s) of the "Review site details" page, specifically for sites that have been provided via file upload.

The change links for an uploaded site are simple 'bounce' links, where the user goes to a data page to change - for example - the site name, and then they are immediately returned to the "Review site details" page. In these scenarios, there will not be a "Cancel" link on the data page.

## Resources
