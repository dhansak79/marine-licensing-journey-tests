# ML-379: Submission of Case to D365

## User Story

**AS** an MMO internal user  
**I WANT** to be able to view submitted exemption notifications  
**SO THAT** I can review the details submitted

## Background

When an exemption notification is submitted through the marine licensing application, the system needs to create a corresponding case in Dynamics 365. This integration will send the exemption reference and project name to D365 to create a new case record for MMO case management purposes.

## Resources

- Microsoft Power Automate API documentation
- Dynamics 365 case creation guidance
- OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow documentation

## Out of Scope

- Additional data fields beyond exemption reference and project name
- Error handling and retry logic for failed submissions
- Real-time status updates to users about submission progress
- User-facing UI for case management in D365
- Detailed audit logging of D365 integration calls

## Questions and Answers

**Q.** Which fields from the exemption will be sent to Dynamics 365?

**A.** Only the exemption reference (e.g., "EXE/2025/10036") and the project name will be mapped to create the D365 case.

**Q.** Will this affect the user's experience during submission?

**A.** No, the D365 case creation will happen as part of the submission process without impacting the user journey.

**Q.** What happens if the D365 integration fails?

**A.** Error handling and retry logic will be addressed in a separate story. Initially, this will be a simple integration.

## Screenshots

### Screenshot 1: D365 Case Creation Data Flow

**Data mapping from exemption to D365 case:**

```
Exemption Submission:
- Reference: "EXE/2025/10036"
- Project Name: "Hammersmith pontoon construction"

            ↓ (API call)

D365 Case Created:
- Case Reference: "EXE/2025/10036"
- Case Title: "Hammersmith pontoon construction"
- Case Type: "Exemption Notification"
```

### Screenshot 2: Integration Flow

**Simple integration process:**

1. User completes exemption submission
2. System calls D365 API with exemption reference and project name
3. D365 creates new case record
4. User sees confirmation page with exemption reference

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1 - Create D365 Case on Exemption Submission

**GIVEN** a user has successfully submitted an exemption notification (see [ML-84](https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-84))

**WHEN** the notification submission is processed

**THEN** a new case is created in Dynamics 365 with:

- **Exemption Reference** - the unique reference number generated for the notification (e.g., "EXE/2025/10036")
- **Project Name** - the project name provided by the user (e.g., "Hammersmith pontoon construction")

## Standard Behaviour

**Error handling** - any errors during D365 case creation will be logged appropriately for debugging purposes.

**Configuration management** - all sensitive configuration values (such as D365 API credentials) will be retrieved from the vault system.

**Security** - all API communications with Dynamics 365 will use HTTPS and appropriate authentication mechanisms.

**Logging** - successful case creation will be logged for audit purposes, including the exemption reference and D365 case identifier.

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed Implementation

- **D365 case creation integration** - Complete integration workflow that creates cases in Dynamics 365 when exemption notifications are submitted
- **Case verification testing** - End-to-end test automation that verifies cases are correctly created and accessible in D365
- **Authentication integration** - Microsoft authentication flow for accessing D365 interface in test environments
- **Reference and project name mapping** - Verified data mapping from exemption notification to D365 case fields
- **Environment-specific execution** - Tests only run in integrated environments where D365 connectivity is available

### Technical Implementation Details

1. **Feature File**: `test/features/submit.notification.to.d365.feature` with @d365 tag for environment-specific execution
2. **Integration Task**: `ViewSubmittedExemptionNotification` task handles D365 case verification workflow
3. **D365 Page Object**: Complete page object implementation for interacting with Dynamics 365 interface
4. **Authentication**: `BrowseD365` ability with Playwright integration for modern web application testing
5. **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive scenario testing exemption reference and project name display in case records

### Integration Points

- **Submit Notification (ML-84)**: D365 case creation triggered by exemption submission
- **Application Reference (ML-21)**: Generated reference numbers verified in D365 case records
- **Environment Configuration**: D365_URL, D365_USER_ID, and D365_USER_PASSWORD environment variables

### Execution Context

**Environment Requirements:**

- Only executes in integrated environments (test/staging/production)
- Requires D365 connectivity and authentication credentials
- Uses @d365 tag for conditional execution based on environment

**Priority:** Complete - Full D365 integration testing implemented with comprehensive case creation verification and appropriate environment-specific execution controls.
