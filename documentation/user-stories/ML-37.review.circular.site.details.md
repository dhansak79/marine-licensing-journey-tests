# ML-37: Review Circular Site Details

## User Story

**AS** an applicant  
**I WANT** to review the details of the circular site that I added manually  
**SO THAT** I can confirm that everything is correct

## Background

Once the user has manually provided the details of their circular site (i.e. the coordinates of the centre point and the width), they will be able to review the details of their site. This page will have slightly different behaviour for other types of site such as file upload, and will also change once multiple sites is implemented.

## Resources

- Link to "Review site details" page prototype MVP - Circle centre and width version
- Link to data dictionary

## Out of scope

This story does not cover the ability to make changes to any of the data from this page - the "Change" links will be added as part of a later story

This story does not include the "Map view" part of the summary card, the rendering of the site coordinates will be delivered under a separate ticket

This story does not cover the review of sites that have been provided via the multiple coordinates page, file upload or drawing on a map

This story does not cover multiple sites behaviour

This story does not include an "Are you sure?" type validation message when the user clicks "Cancel"

This story does not cover the link for the survey in the header

This story does not cover the links in the footer

## Questions and answers

**Q.** Should the width display indicate that this represents the diameter of the circular site?  
**A.** TBC - this may be addressed through hint text or clarification in the display format.

## Screenshots

### Screenshot 1: Review site details page - WGS84 coordinates

**Page layout showing:**

- Standard GOV.UK header with "Get permission for a marine activity" service name
- Beta banner with feedback link
- Back link for navigation
- "Hammersmith pontoon project" displayed as page caption above the main heading
- "Review site details" as the main H1 heading
- Site details summary card containing:
  - **Method of providing site location**: "Manually enter one set of coordinates and a width to create a circular site"
  - **Coordinate system**: "WGS84 (World Geodetic System 1984) Latitude and longitude"
  - **Coordinates at centre of site**: "123456, 987654" (example coordinates in latitude, longitude format)
  - **Width of circular site**: "3 metres"
  - **Map view**: [Not implemented in this story - placeholder row]
- "Save and continue" button (green) and "Cancel" link positioned below the summary card
- Standard GOV.UK footer with licensing and regulatory information

### Screenshot 2: Review site details page - OSGB36 coordinates

**Page layout showing:**

- Same overall layout as Screenshot 1
- Site details summary card with alternative coordinate system display:
  - **Method of providing site location**: "Manually enter one set of coordinates and a width to create a circular site"
  - **Coordinate system**: "OSGB36 (National Grid) Eastings and Northings"
  - **Coordinates at centre of site**: "123456, 987654" (example coordinates in eastings, northings format)
  - **Width of circular site**: "3 metres"
  - **Map view**: [Not implemented in this story - placeholder row]
- Same navigation and action elements as Screenshot 1

**Note**: Change links shown in the prototype are not included in this implementation phase

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1 - Display page

**GIVEN** I have provided the details of my circular site (see [ML-35: Enter Centre Point of a Circle](./ML-35.enter.centre.point.of.a.circle.md) and [ML-36: Enter Width of Circular Site](./ML-36.enter.width.of.circular.site.md))  
**WHEN** I select the "Continue" button  
**THEN** the "Review site details" page is displayed:

- the page appears as per the prototype (see exceptions to this in the next AC)
- the project name will appear as the page caption
- the page is populated with the details of the site that has just been provided

### AC2 - Summary card content

**GIVEN** I have provided the centre of a circle and a width for my site  
**WHEN** I view the "Review site details" page  
**THEN** the summary card will contain the following details:

- **Method of providing site location** - populated with fixed text: "Manually enter one set of coordinates and a width to create a circular site"
- **Coordinate system** - populated with the chosen coordinate system, display either:
  - "WGS84 (World Geodetic System 1984) Latitude and longitude" OR
  - "OSGB36 (National Grid) Eastings and Northings"
- **Coordinates at centre of site** - populated with the coordinates provided, display either:
  - "\<latitude\>, \<longitude\>" OR
  - "\<eastings\>, \<northings\>"
- **Width of circular site** - populated with the width of the site, displayed as "\<width\> metres"
- **Map view** - the "Map view" row shown in the prototype will not be delivered as part of this story, it will be delivered as a separate ticket, subject to a spike for the map rendering

**NOTE** - the "Change" links shown in the prototype will not be delivered as part of this story, they will be delivered as a separate ticket

### AC3 - Save and continue

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Review site details" page  
**WHEN** I select the "Save and continue" option  
**THEN** the site information is saved to my notification  
**AND** I am returned to the task list  
**AND** the status of the "Site details" task is updated to "Completed"

### AC4 - Cancel

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Review site details" page  
**WHEN** I select the "Cancel" option  
**THEN** I am returned to the task list:

- the status of the task will not be updated
- the details of the site that I have provided so far will be discarded

### AC5 - Back

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Review site details" page  
**WHEN** I select the "Back" option  
**THEN** I am taken to the previous page in the flow i.e. the "Enter the width of the circular site in metres" page (see [ML-36: Enter Width of Circular Site](./ML-36.enter.width.of.circular.site.md))  
**AND** the answer that I previously provided on that page will be pre-populated

## Standard behaviour

**"Back" link** - when I select the "Back" link (if present), I will be returned to the page I was on immediately prior to the current page. Any changes I made on the current page will be discarded.

**"Cancel" link** - when I select the "Cancel" link (if present) I will be returned to the task list. Any changes I made on the current page will be discarded.

**Displaying validation errors** - if any validation errors are triggered, they will be displayed in standard GDS format i.e. [error summary](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-summary/) at the top of the page, and [error message](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-message/) against the specific item that triggered the error. The wording of error messages should be verified against the data dictionary.

## Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed Implementation

- **Core review functionality** - Complete site details review page displaying all entered information
- **Summary card display** - All required site details displayed according to coordinate system (WGS84/OSGB36)
- **Data verification** - Comprehensive validation that all site details are correctly shown:
  - Method of providing site location
  - Coordinate system with full descriptive names
  - Coordinates formatted correctly based on chosen system
  - Width displayed with metres unit
- **Navigation flow** - Save and continue functionality completing site details task
- **Task completion** - Site details task status updated to "Completed" after successful review
- **Test automation** - Complete feature test coverage for both WGS84 and OSGB36 flows

### Technical Implementation Details

1. **Page Object Pattern**: `ReviewSiteDetailsPage` class with comprehensive selectors for summary list elements
2. **Screenplay Pattern**: `EnsureSiteDetails` interaction validates correct display based on coordinate system
3. **Test Coverage**: Updated circular site feature scenarios to include complete review flow
4. **Step Definitions**: Added support for verifying site details review and task completion

### Integration Points

- Seamlessly integrates with ML-35 (centre point entry) and ML-36 (width entry)
- Completes the circular site entry flow from coordinate system selection through to task completion
- Maintains consistency with established site details flow patterns

**Priority:** Complete - Full user journey functionality implemented and tested for both coordinate systems.
