## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1 - View existing sites from task list

**GIVEN** I have added at least one site  
**WHEN** I select the "Site details" option on the task list  
**THEN** I will be taken to the "Review site details" page so that I can see my existing set of sites

## Standard Behaviour

**Task List Navigation** - when I select a task from the task list, I will be taken to the appropriate page to complete or review that task. For the Site details task, if sites have already been added, clicking the task will take me directly to the Review site details page.

**"Back" link** - when I select the "Back" link (if present), I will be returned to the page I was on immediately prior to the current page. Any changes I made on the current page will be discarded.

**"Cancel" link** - when I select the "Cancel" link (if present) I will be returned to the task list. Any changes I made on the current page will be discarded.

**Review Site Details Page** - this page allows users to view all their added sites, make changes to existing sites, add missing information, or delete sites (for manually entered sites only). The behaviour of these actions is covered in other user stories.

**Task Status Indicators** - the Site details task status will reflect the completion state:

- "Not yet started" - no sites have been added yet
- "In progress" - at least one site has been added but some required information is incomplete
- "Completed" - all sites have been added with complete information

**Displaying validation errors** - if any validation errors are triggered, they will be displayed in standard GDS format i.e. [error summary](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-summary/) at the top of the page, and [error message](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-message/) against the specific item that triggered the error. The wording of error messages should be verified against the data dictionary.
