# ML-279: Footer Links

## User Story

**AS** an applicant  
**I WANT** to see a footer with useful links at the bottom of every page  
**SO THAT** I can quickly navigate to important pages

## Background

Our pages need to comply with the GDS standard footer template.

## Resources

Footer template – GOV.UK Design System

Prototype

## Out of Scope

This is just to provide the footer content - not the content of the pages linked from it.

The screenshot below contains prototype-specific links that are not required:

- Manage your prototype
- Clear data
- View data
- Share page

The content for the accessibility statement will be complete once we have completed accessibility testing. New ticket required.

## Questions and Answers

Can we link to a placeholder?

Do we need a ticket for the sitemap?

The footer links go straight to the destination pages, not to a new tab

## Screenshots

### Screenshot 1: Standard GOV.UK Footer

**Footer layout showing:**

- **Crown Logo**: Standard black crown logo positioned in the top left corner of the footer area, maintaining consistency with GOV.UK branding standards
- **Footer Links**: Left-aligned navigation links including:
  - **Privacy**: Link to the privacy policy page (placeholder until ML-644 implementation)
  - **Cookies**: Link to the cookies policy page (covered by ML-278)
- **Open Government Licence Statement**: Central footer text stating "All content is available under the Open Government Licence v3.0, except where otherwise stated" with underlined link to the OGL licence page
- **Royal Coat of Arms**: Right-aligned Royal coat of arms image displaying the official UK government heraldic symbol
- **Crown Copyright**: "© Crown copyright" text positioned in the bottom right corner with link to the National Archives crown copyright information
- **Clean Layout**: Minimal, professional footer design following GOV.UK design system patterns with appropriate spacing and typography
- **Consistent Styling**: Footer background and text colours conforming to standard government service design guidelines
- **Accessibility Compliance**: Proper semantic HTML structure with appropriate link text and image alt attributes for screen readers

The footer demonstrates full compliance with GDS standards while providing essential legal and navigation links required for government digital services.

**Open Government Licence Link** - when I select the "Open Government Licence v3.0" link, I will be taken to the National Archives OGL page providing details about content licensing.

**Crown Copyright Link** - when I select the "© Crown copyright" link, I will be taken to the National Archives page explaining crown copyright and government licensing framework.

**Same Window Navigation** - all footer links will open in the same browser window/tab, maintaining user context within the service.

**Responsive Design** - the footer will adapt appropriately for different screen sizes while maintaining all required elements and functionality.

**Accessibility** - all footer elements will be keyboard accessible and include appropriate ARIA labels and alt text for screen readers.
