# ML-120: FILE - Are All Activity Descriptions the Same?

## User Story

**AS** an applicant  
**I WANT** to re-use the same activity description for all my uploaded sites where appropriate  
**SO THAT** I do not have to keep re-entering the same description

## Background

As part of the multiple sites work, it is necessary for the applicant to provide a description for each site they have uploaded for their notification. Previously, the user only had to provide a description for the notification as a whole.

In reality, where the uploaded file contains multiple sites, the description will frequently be the same for all sites, so the service will ask the user if they wish to re-use the same description for all of their sites.

Note that the logic around re-using the description is slightly different for manually entered sites (circular sites and polygon sites) so that is covered under a separate story.

## Resources

## Out of Scope

Logic around re-using descriptions for manually entered sites (circular sites and polygon sites) is covered under a separate story (https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-119)

## Questions and Answers

TBC

## Screenshots

### Screenshot 1: Activity Description Same for Every Site Page (File Upload Version)

**Page layout showing:**

- Standard GOV.UK header with crown logo and "GOV.UK" branding
- Blue service header containing "Get permission for marine work" as the service name
- Navigation area on the right side of the service header containing "Projects home", "Defra account", and "Sign out" links
- Beta banner with blue background stating "This is a new service. Help us improve it and give your feedback (opens in new tab)." with an underlined feedback link
- Back link (with left arrow) for navigation to return to the previous page
- "South coast sea samples" displayed as the project name caption above the main heading
- "Is the activity description the same for every site?" as the main H1 heading in large, bold text
- Two radio button options with helper text:
  1. "Yes, the description is the same for every site" with helper text "You'll only need to enter the description once"
  2. "No, at least one site has a different description" with helper text "You'll add a description for each site on the 'Review site details' page"
- "Continue" button with green background positioned below the radio button options
- "Cancel" link in blue text positioned to the right of the Continue button
- Standard GOV.UK footer with licensing and regulatory information

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1 - Display page

**GIVEN** I have successfully uploaded my coordinate file  
**AND** there is more than one site in the file I uploaded  
**WHEN** I select:

- the "Continue" button on the "Activity dates" page - see https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-75, or
- The "Continue button on the "Are all the activity dates the same?" page (with "No" radio button selected) - see https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-119

**THEN** the "Is the activity description the same for every site?" page is displayed

**NOTE** - if there is only one site in the uploaded file then I will not see this page

### AC2 - Page behaviour

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Is the activity description the same for every site?" page (as per AC1)  
**WHEN** the page is loaded  
**THEN** the page appears as per the prototype  
**AND** the project name will appear as the page caption  
**AND** neither radio button is selected by default

### AC3 - Validation

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Is the activity description the same for every site?" page  
**AND** I have not selected a radio button on the page  
**WHEN** I select the "Continue" button  
**THEN** I will see an error message - "Select whether the activity description is the same for every site"

### AC4 - Continue

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Is the activity description the same for every site?" page  
**AND** I have selected either radio button on the page  
**WHEN** I select the "Continue" button  
**THEN** I will remain on the same page (navigating to the next page will be covered in another story)

### AC5 - Cancel

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Is the activity description the same for every site?" page  
**WHEN** I select the "Cancel" option  
**THEN** I am returned to the task list:

- the status of the task will not be updated
- any answers that I have provided so far will be discarded
- any file I have uploaded will be discarded

### AC6 - Back

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Is the activity description the same for every site?" page as part of a file upload journey  
**WHEN** I select the "Back" option  
**THEN** I am taken to the previous page in the flow i.e. depending on where I came from, either:

- the "Activity dates" page, or
- the "Are all the activity dates the same?" page

**AND** my previous answers on those pages are defaulted in as expected

## Standard Behaviour

**"Back" link** - when I select the "Back" link (if present), I will be returned to the page I was on immediately prior to the current page. Any changes I made on the current page will be discarded.

**"Cancel" link** - when I select the "Cancel" link (if present) I will be returned to the task list. Any changes I made on the current page will be discarded.

**Displaying validation errors** - if any validation errors are triggered, they will be displayed in standard GDS format i.e. [error summary](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-summary/) at the top of the page, and [error message](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-message/) against the specific item that triggered the error. The wording of error messages should be verified against the data dictionary.
