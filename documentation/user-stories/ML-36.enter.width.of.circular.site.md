# ML-36: Enter Width of Circular Site

## User Story

**AS** an applicant  
**I WANT** to enter the width of my site (having previously provided the centre point for the site)  
**SO THAT** I can provide an accurate location for my project

## Background

This story provides the user with the ability to enter the width of their circular site which, when combined with the coordinates for the centre point (see separate story), will define a circular boundary for the location of their project.

## Resources

- Link to "Enter the width of the circular site in metres" prototype MVP
- Link to data dictionary
- [Design system guidance on text input](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/text-input/)

## Out of scope

- This story does not cover the restriction of circle width to prevent overly large circles from being defined. This could be controlled via a separate ticket if necessary
- Navigation to the next page in the flow will be covered by a separate story
- This story does not cover the survey link and other links in the header
- This story does not cover the links in the footer

## Questions and answers

**Q.** What level of precision do we want for the width? Should we be allowing whole numbers only (e.g. 20 metres), or should we allow decimals too, and if so, how many decimal places (1dp seems like it would be enough, anything more would be measuring down to the centimetre, which feels like overkill).  
**A.** whole number of metres (though possibly need to revisit in later journeys). Agreed on refinement.

**Q.** Do we need a minimum width for the circle? Or maximum?  
**A.** Minimum of 1 metre. No max defined in this story, could be added later if needed.

**Q.** Can we restrict the user to just entering integers, and not allow them to type anything else I.e. alpha characters, special characters)  
**A.** No, this does not fit with GDS guidance.

## Screenshots

### Screenshot 1: Flow diagram showing user journey

This diagram illustrates the user journey flow for site location entry within the marine licensing application. The diagram shows:

- Starting from the task list, users can choose between "Upload a file" (leading to Shapefile/KML upload options) or "Enter coordinates manually"
- The manual entry path splits into "Centre and circle" or "Coordinate list" options
- For centre and circle, users first select coordinate system (WGS84 or OSGB86)
- After entering coordinates at centre point, users proceed to "Enter the width of the circular site in metres" (highlighted in blue box)
- The flow concludes with "Review site details"
- Alternative coordinate list paths are also shown leading to boundary marking and review

### Screenshot 2: Width entry page

This page shows the width entry interface for circular sites. The page displays:

- Standard GOV.UK header with "MMO" branding and navigation (Projects home, Defra account, Sign out)
- Beta banner indicating "This is a new service. Help us improve it and give your feedback (opens in new tab)."
- Breadcrumb navigation with "Back" link
- Project context: "Hammersmith pontoon project" as the page caption
- Main heading "Enter the width of the circular site in metres"
- A text input field with "metres" label to the right
- "Continue" button (green) and "Cancel" link positioned below the input
- Standard GOV.UK footer with copyright notice and regulatory information

## Acceptance criteria

### AC1 - display page

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Enter the coordinates at the centre point of the site" page (see [ML-35: Enter Centre Point of a Circle](./ML-35.enter.centre.point.of.a.circle.md))  
**WHEN** I select the "Continue" button  
**THEN** the "Enter the width of the circular site in metres" page is displayed:

- the page appears as per the prototype
- the project name will appear as the page caption
- the page is blank by default
- if I have previously provided information on this page then that data will be pre-populated

**NOTE** - from the GDS guidance (see Resources section above), "If you're asking the user to enter a whole number, set the inputmode attribute to numeric to use the numeric keypad on devices with on-screen keyboards."

### AC2 - validation

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Enter the width of the circular site in metres" page  
**WHEN** I select the "Continue" button  
**THEN** the following mandatory field validation will be performed:

- if no width has been provided, error: "Enter the width of the circular site in metres"
- if a non-numeric value has been provided, error: "The width of the circular site must be a number"
- if a negative value has been provided, error: "The width of the circular site must be 1 metre or more"
- if a non-integer value has been provided, error: "The width of the circular site must be a whole number, like 10"

**TECHNICAL NOTE** - if during implementation, it becomes clear that there is a technical limitation regarding how big a number we can store in the database, we may need to add a front-end restriction (and associated error message) for max size.

### AC3 - Continue

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Enter the width of the circular site in metres" page  
**AND** I have provided width which will pass the validation defined in the previous AC  
**WHEN** I select the "Continue" button  
**THEN** I will remain on the same page (navigation to the next page will be covered by a separate story)  
**AND** the width of the site will be saved

### AC4 - Cancel

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Enter the width of the circular site in metres" page  
**WHEN** I select the "Cancel" option  
**THEN** I am returned to the task list:

- the status of the task will not be updated
- the details of the site that I have provided so far will be discarded

### AC5 - Back

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Enter the width of the circular site in metres" page  
**WHEN** I select the "Back" option  
**THEN** I am taken to the previous page in the flow i.e. the "Enter the coordinates at the centre point of the site" page (see [ML-35: Enter Centre Point of a Circle](./ML-35.enter.centre.point.of.a.circle.md))  
**AND** the information that I previously provided on that page will be pre-populated

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed Implementation

- **Core width entry functionality** - Width validation and successful submission
- **Comprehensive validation** - All validation scenarios from AC2 covered:
  - Mandatory field validation
  - Non-numeric value validation
  - Negative value validation
  - Non-integer value validation
- **Error message display** - Clear validation messages matching acceptance criteria
- **Basic navigation** - Continue functionality and task completion
- **Test automation** - Complete validation coverage in feature files

### ⚠️ Work in Progress (Planned for future implementation)

**Back and Cancel Navigation:**

- Back navigation from width entry page to centre point coordinates page
- Cancel functionality from width entry page with data discard validation
- State preservation during navigation flow

**Technical Notes:**

- Back and cancel navigation tests are part of a broader strategy for improving navigation test coverage across the entire site details flow
- Core user journey functionality is complete and fully tested
- Navigation edge cases will be addressed as part of upcoming navigation test strategy improvements

**Priority:** Low - Core user journey functionality is complete. Navigation edge cases don't impact primary use cases.
