# ML-361: MANUAL - RSD - Display First Manually Entered Site on Review Site Details

## User Story

**AS** an applicant  
**I WANT** to review the details of the first site that I manually entered  
**SO THAT** I can confirm that everything is correct

## Background

Once the user has manually entered their first site (and indicated that they wish to add more than one), they will be able to review the details of the site. This story builds upon the initial implementation of the "Review site details" page delivered for iteration 1, with some restructuring and adding the date & description information.

We will implement showing more than one site on the review site details page under https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-608. This has been split out because it would not be possible to test the display of more than one site, since we have not implemented the 'add another site' behaviour yet.

## Resources

- Link to "Review site details" page in multiple sites v2 prototype - manual entry route, one site added - different dates, same description
- See comments for full set of prototype links for each scenario (links are too long to be stored in Jira description field)
- Link to data dictionary

## Out of Scope

This story does not cover:

- The ability to make changes to any of the data from this page - the behaviour of the "Change" links will be provided in a later story
- An "Are you sure?" type validation message when the user clicks "Cancel"
- The "Delete site" option
- The "Add another site" option
- The link for the survey in the header
- The links in the footer

## Questions and Answers

TBC

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1 - Display page

**GIVEN** I am adding sites to my notification via manual entry  
**AND** I have indicated that I need to add more than one site  
**AND** I am adding the first of my sites  
**WHEN** I select the "Continue" button after inputting coordinates of the new site  
**THEN** I will be taken to the "Review site details" page (originally developed under https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-37)  
**AND** the page will have a number of enhancements as per the following ACs

**NOTE** - it will also be possible to reach this page through other routes (as per the flow diagram above), but those behaviours will be covered in other tickets

### AC2 - Display text at bottom of the page

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Review site details" page via manual entry as per the first AC  
**WHEN** the page is loaded  
**THEN** I see a paragraph of text at the bottom of the page as per the prototype (see second screenshot above)  
**AND** the text appears after the "Save and add another site" button (note the spacing in the screenshot)

**NOTE** - "Save and add another site" button at the bottom of the page is not within the scope of this ticket

### AC3 - New "Providing the site location" summary card

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Review site details" page via manual entry as per the first AC  
**WHEN** the page is loaded  
**THEN** the page contains a new "Providing the site location" summary card  
**AND** the summary card contains the following rows:

- **Method of providing the site location** - "Enter the coordinates of the site manually"
- **More than one site** - "Yes"

**NOTE** - "Change" links in the "Providing the site location" summary card are not within the scope of this ticket

### AC4 - New "Activity details" summary card

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Review site details" page via manual entry as per the first AC  
**WHEN** the page is loaded  
**THEN** the page contains a new "Activity details" summary card  
**AND** the summary card contains the following rows:

- **Are the activity dates the same for every site?** - displays either "Yes" or "No" depending on how the user answered during the journey
- **Activity dates** - displays the date range provided during the journey. This row is only displayed if I selected that the dates are the same for every site
- **Is the activity description the same for every site?** - displays either "Yes" or "No" depending on how the user answered during the journey
- **Activity description** - displays the description provided during the journey. This row is only displayed if I selected that the description is the same for every site

**NOTE** - the "Activity details" summary card is intended to summarise the dates and descriptions for activities where the user has indicated that sites share the same dates/description. The idea is to display those shared pieces of information once at the top of the page, rather than repeating the same data in every summary card for every site. Where dates/descriptions are not shared, they will be displayed against each individual site as expected.

**NOTE** - "Change" links in the "Activity details" summary card are not within the scope of this ticket

- **Site name** - displays name provided for the site
- **Activity dates** - displays the dates provided for the site. This row is only displayed if I selected that the dates are not the same for every site
- **Activity description** - displays the description provided for the site. This row is only displayed if I selected that the description is not the same for every site

**NOTE** - the "Change" links and "Delete site" link in the "Site details" summary card are not within the scope of this ticket

## Standard Behaviour

**"Back" link** - when I select the "Back" link (if present), I will be returned to the page I was on immediately prior to the current page. Any changes I made on the current page will be discarded.

**"Cancel" link** - when I select the "Cancel" link (if present) I will be returned to the task list. Any changes I made on the current page will be discarded.

**Displaying validation errors** - if any validation errors are triggered, they will be displayed in standard GDS format i.e. [error summary](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-summary/) at the top of the page, and [error message](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-message/) against the specific item that triggered the error. The wording of error messages should be verified against the data dictionary.
