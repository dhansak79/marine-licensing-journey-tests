# ML-70: Upload a coordinate file

## User story

**AS** an applicant  
**I WANT** to upload a file of coordinates for my site  
**SO THAT** I can provide my site details easily and accurately

## Background

As part of the journey to provide sites for the notification, the user can upload either a KML file or a Shapefile.

## Resources

- Link to "Upload a file" page in prototype MVP
- Link to "File upload spinner" page
- Link to data dictionary
- [GDS design system - file upload component](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/file-upload/)
- [CDP uploader readme](https://github.com/DEFRA/cdp-uploader/blob/main/README.md)

## Out of scope

- This story does not cover timeout if the file upload takes too long. This is covered in [ML-254](https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-254)
- This story does not cover validation based on file type when the user is uploading a Shapefile. This is covered in [ML-255](https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-255)
- Navigation to the next page in the flow will be covered by a separate story
- This story does not cover the survey link and other links in the header
- This story does not cover the links in the footer

## Questions and answers

**Q.** What is the maximum file size we want to allow?

**A.** Agreed 50MB as an initial value, with the ability to change later if needed.

**Q.** Should virus checking be covered in this ticket?

**A.** Yes - as discussed in refinement on 9/6/25.

**Q.** Is it possible for us to detect if the file is empty or password protected?

**A.** Yes - as discussed in refinement on 9/6/25.

## Acceptance criteria

### AC1 - Display page

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Which type of file do you want to upload?" page (see [ML-69](https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-69))  
**AND** I have selected either radio button  
**WHEN** I select the "Continue" button  
**THEN** the "Upload a file" page is displayed:

- the page appears as per the prototype
- the project name will appear as the page caption
- the page title (H1) and hint text reflect the file type I chose on the previous page (either "Upload a Shapefile" or "Upload a KML file")
- initially no file is chosen

### AC2 - Choose a file

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Upload a file" page  
**WHEN** I select the "Choose file" button  
**THEN** the system dialog will open which will allow me to choose a file to upload  
**AND** the system dialog will default to allowing .kml files if KML was chosen (where possible based on operating system)  
**AND** the name of the selected file will be displayed on the page

**NOTE** - for Shapefile upload, there is a separate ticket to cover validation based on file type (since Shapefile is actually a collection of files usually provided as a zip file)

### AC3 - Drop a file

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Upload a file" page  
**WHEN** I drag and drop a file onto the file upload section of the page  
**THEN** the name of the file will be displayed on the page

### AC4 - Validation

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Upload a file" page  
**WHEN** I select the "Continue" button  
**THEN** the following validation will be performed:

- if no file is provided, error - "Select a file to upload"
- if the wrong type of file is provided, error - "The selected file must be a KML file" (NOTE - Shapefile file type validation will be covered under a separate ticket)
- if the file is larger than 50 MB, error - "The selected file must be smaller than 50 MB"
- if the file is empty, error - "The selected file is empty"
- if the file contains a virus, error - "The selected file contains a virus"
- if the file is password-protected, error - "The selected file is password protected" (split to [ML-434](https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-434))
- if there was a problem and the file could not be uploaded, error - "The selected file could not be uploaded – try again"

### AC5 - Continue

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Upload a file" page  
**AND** I have selected a file  
**WHEN** I select the "Continue" button  
**THEN** I will be taken to the "File upload spinner" page (see prototype)  
**AND** I will remain on that page until either:

- the file is uploaded successfully, at which point I will be redirected back to the "File upload" page with no errors showing
- there is an error with the file upload, at which point I will be redirected back to the "File upload" page with the appropriate error showing

### AC6 - Cancel

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Upload a file" page  
**WHEN** I select the "Cancel" option  
**THEN** I am returned to the task list:

- the status of the task will not be updated
- any changes I have made on the page are not saved

### AC7 - Back

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Upload a file" page  
**WHEN** I select the "Back" option  
**THEN** I am returned to the previous page in the flow (the "Which type of file do you want to upload?" page)

## Standard behaviour

**"Back" link** - when I select the "Back" link (if present), I will be returned to the page I was on immediately prior to the current page. Any changes I made on the current page will be discarded.

**"Cancel" link** - when I select the "Cancel" link (if present) I will be returned to the task list. Any changes I made on the current page will be discarded.

**Displaying validation errors** - if any validation errors are triggered, they will be displayed in standard GDS format i.e. [error summary](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-summary/) at the top of the page, and [error message](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-message/) against the specific item that triggered the error. The wording of error messages should be verified against the data dictionary.
