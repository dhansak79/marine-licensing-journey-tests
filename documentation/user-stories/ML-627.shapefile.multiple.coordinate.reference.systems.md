# ML-627: Shapefile File Upload - Add Support for Multiple Coordinate Reference Systems

## User Story

**AS** an applicant  
**I WANT** to upload Shapefile coordinate files in various coordinate reference systems  
**SO THAT** my site coordinates are correctly processed regardless of the coordinate system used in my source files

## Background

We are using [Shapefile](https://www.npmjs.com/package/shapefile) as our library to read and parse coordinates from Shapefile zips. We are extracting to geoJSON [RFC 7946](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946).

GeoJSON specifies that all coordinates are in WGS84.

The issue is that the parsing library is not converting other coordinate systems into valid geoJSON.

This is caveated in the README:

> This library does not support parsing coordinate reference system specifications (.prj); see Proj4js for parsing well-known text (WKT) specifications.

We might want to:

- investigate the Shapefile format to determine all possible coordinate systems that may be allowed in our source files
- determine a tactical fix (if any)
- determine a strategic fix

E.g. either we do the conversion into WGS84 ourselves, perhaps using an additional package, or we see if there is a better parsing library that produces valid and conformant geoJSON.

This problem does not apply to KML files, as I believe they use WGS84 internally.

## Resources

- [Shapefile npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/shapefile)
- [GeoJSON RFC 7946](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946)
- [Proj4js - coordinate transformation library](https://github.com/proj4js/proj4js)
- [Well-known text (WKT) coordinate reference system specifications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_coordinate_reference_systems)
- Shapefile .prj file format documentation
- OSGB36 (British National Grid) coordinate system documentation
- EPSG coordinate reference system database

## Out of Scope

- KML file coordinate system handling (already uses WGS84)
- Frontend coordinate system selection by users
- Manual coordinate entry validation
- Historical coordinate reference system support beyond commonly used systems

## Questions and Answers

**Q.** What coordinate reference systems are commonly used in Shapefiles submitted to MMO?

**A.** TBC - requires investigation of existing MCMS data and consultation with MMO stakeholders.

**Q.** Should we support all possible coordinate reference systems or focus on the most common ones?

**A.** TBC - will be determined as part of the investigation phase.

**Q.** What should happen when a Shapefile uses an unsupported coordinate reference system?

**A.** TBC - options include: display clear error message, attempt best-effort conversion, or reject the file with guidance.

**Q.** Can we use Proj4js to handle the coordinate transformations?

**A.** TBC - requires technical investigation to assess compatibility, performance, and accuracy.

**Q.** Should we validate the coordinate reference system before or during file processing?

**A.** TBC - needs to balance user experience (early validation) with technical efficiency.

## Technical Investigation

### Current State

- **Shapefile parsing**: Uses shapefile npm package
- **Output format**: GeoJSON (RFC 7946)
- **GeoJSON requirement**: All coordinates must be in WGS84
- **Current limitation**: Parser does not convert from other coordinate systems
- **Missing capability**: No .prj file parsing (coordinate reference system specification)

### Investigation Areas

1. **Shapefile Format Analysis**
   - Identify all coordinate reference systems used in .prj files
   - Analyse common coordinate systems in UK marine licensing context
   - Determine frequency of non-WGS84 coordinate systems in user submissions

2. **Tactical Solution Options**
   - Implement Proj4js integration for coordinate transformation
   - Add .prj file parsing capability
   - Validate coordinate reference system before processing
   - Provide clear error messages for unsupported systems

3. **Strategic Solution Options**
   - Evaluate alternative Shapefile parsing libraries with built-in CRS support
   - Implement comprehensive coordinate transformation pipeline
   - Create extensible system for adding new coordinate reference systems
   - Consider caching transformation definitions for performance

### Proposed Approach

**Phase 1: Investigation**

- Analyse existing MCMS Shapefile submissions to identify used coordinate systems
- Research Shapefile .prj file format and common coordinate reference systems
- Evaluate Proj4js capabilities and limitations

**Phase 2: Tactical Implementation**

- Implement .prj file parsing
- Integrate Proj4js for coordinate transformation to WGS84
- Add validation for supported coordinate reference systems
- Implement error handling for unsupported systems

**Phase 3: Testing & Validation**

- Test with real-world Shapefiles in various coordinate systems
- Verify accuracy of coordinate transformations
- Ensure GeoJSON output conforms to RFC 7946
- Validate integration with existing file upload workflow

### Diagram 1: Current Shapefile Processing Flow

```
User uploads Shapefile (.zip)
         ↓
Extract Shapefile components (.shp, .shx, .dbf, .prj)
         ↓
Parse using shapefile library
         ↓
❌ ISSUE: Coordinates not in WGS84 if .prj specifies different CRS
         ↓
Output GeoJSON (non-conformant if not WGS84)
         ↓
❌ Invalid GeoJSON for coordinates in other systems
```

### Diagram 2: Proposed Enhanced Processing Flow

```
User uploads Shapefile (.zip)
         ↓
Extract Shapefile components (.shp, .shx, .dbf, .prj)
         ↓
Parse .prj file to identify coordinate reference system
         ↓
Parse shapefile using shapefile library
         ↓
✅ NEW: Transform coordinates to WGS84 using Proj4js
         ↓
Output valid GeoJSON (RFC 7946 conformant)
         ↓
✅ All coordinates in WGS84 as required
```

### Diagram 3: Error Handling for Unsupported CRS

```
User uploads Shapefile with unsupported CRS
         ↓
Parse .prj file
         ↓
Identify coordinate reference system
         ↓
Check against supported CRS list
         ↓
❌ CRS not supported
         ↓
Display clear error message:
"The coordinate system in your Shapefile is not supported.
 Supported systems: WGS84, OSGB36 (British National Grid)
 Please convert your file or contact support."
```

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1 - Investigate coordinate reference systems

**GIVEN** we need to support Shapefile uploads with various coordinate systems  
**WHEN** the investigation is conducted  
**THEN** we will have documented:

- All coordinate reference systems found in historical MMO submissions
- Frequency and priority of each coordinate reference system
- Technical feasibility of supporting each system
- Recommended list of coordinate systems to support

### AC2 - Implement .prj file parsing

**GIVEN** a Shapefile contains a .prj file with coordinate reference system specification  
**WHEN** the file is uploaded and processed  
**THEN** the system will:

- Successfully extract and parse the .prj file
- Identify the coordinate reference system specified
- Log the identified coordinate system for debugging purposes

### AC3 - Implement coordinate transformation to WGS84

**GIVEN** a Shapefile contains coordinates in a supported non-WGS84 coordinate system  
**WHEN** the file is processed  
**THEN** the system will:

- Transform all coordinates from the source coordinate system to WGS84
- Output valid GeoJSON conforming to RFC 7946
- Preserve coordinate accuracy within acceptable tolerances
- Maintain all other Shapefile data (attributes, geometry types)

### AC4 - Handle unsupported coordinate reference systems

**GIVEN** a Shapefile contains coordinates in an unsupported coordinate system  
**WHEN** the file is uploaded  
**THEN** the system will:

- Detect the unsupported coordinate reference system
- Display a clear error message to the user
- Provide guidance on supported coordinate systems
- Prevent invalid data from being saved

### AC5 - Support OSGB36 (British National Grid)

**GIVEN** OSGB36 is commonly used for UK marine licensing  
**WHEN** a Shapefile with OSGB36 coordinates is uploaded  
**THEN** the system will:

- Successfully parse the coordinate reference system
- Transform coordinates from OSGB36 to WGS84
- Output valid GeoJSON with accurate coordinate conversion
- Display the site(s) correctly on the map

### AC6 - Maintain backward compatibility

**GIVEN** existing Shapefiles in WGS84 coordinate system  
**WHEN** these files are uploaded after the changes  
**THEN** the system will:

- Continue to process WGS84 Shapefiles without transformation
- Maintain existing functionality and accuracy
- Ensure no regression in file processing performance

## Standard Behaviour

**Error handling** - coordinate transformation errors will be logged appropriately for debugging and will provide user-friendly error messages indicating the issue and possible solutions.

**Performance** - coordinate transformation should not significantly impact file upload processing time. Large Shapefiles with many features should be processed efficiently.

**Accuracy** - coordinate transformations must maintain positional accuracy appropriate for marine licensing purposes, with acceptable tolerance levels documented and tested.

**Logging** - all coordinate system identifications and transformations will be logged for audit purposes, including source CRS, target CRS, and transformation success/failure.

**Validation** - transformed coordinates will be validated to ensure they fall within expected bounds (e.g., UK territorial waters for marine licensing).

**Configuration** - supported coordinate reference systems will be configurable, allowing new systems to be added without code changes where possible.

**Documentation** - technical documentation will be maintained for supported coordinate systems, transformation parameters, and troubleshooting guidance.
