# ML-18: Choose Coordinate System

## User Story

**AS** an applicant  
**I WANT** to choose which coordinate system I will use to provide location details for my marine project  
**SO THAT** I can pick the correct option based on the coordinates I have

## Background

This is the third page in the site details flow, if the user has chosen to enter coordinates manually (either by entering a list of coordinates and entering a single coordinate point and a width to form a circle). From this page they can choose the coordinate system that they wish to use.

## Resources

- Link to "Which coordinate system do you want to use?" page in prototype MVP
- Link to data dictionary

## Out of scope

- Navigation to the next page in the flow will be covered by a separate story
- This story does not cover the survey link and other links in the header
- This story does not cover the links in the footer

## Questions and answers

TBC

## Screenshots

### Screenshot 1: User Journey Flow

This diagram shows the user journey flow for providing site location details. The highlighted section shows where the coordinate system selection fits into the journey flow. The user can reach this screen after selecting either "Centre and circle" or "Coordinate list" options for manually entering coordinates.

### Screenshot 2: Coordinate System Selection Page

This page shows the "Which coordinate system do you want to use?" interface where the user can select between two coordinate systems:

- WGS84 (World Geodetic System 1984) - Uses latitude and longitude
- OSGB36 (National Grid) - Uses eastings and northings

The page includes the project name ("Hammersmith pontoon construction") as a caption, radio button options, and Continue/Cancel buttons at the bottom.

### Screenshot 3: Coordinate System Selection with Help Text Expanded

This shows the same coordinate system selection page but with the "Help with the coordinate systems" section expanded. The help section provides explanations of:

- WGS84: A global system that pinpoints locations using latitude and longitude. Latitude shows how far north or south a place is, and longitude shows how far east or west it is. WGS84 is widely used in GPS and mapping tools like Google Maps.
- OSGB36: Also known as the British National Grid (BNG), OSGB36 is a system used to map Great Britain. It divides the country into squares using numerical east and north positions, known as eastings and northings.

## Acceptance criteria

### AC1 - display page

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "How do you want to enter the coordinates?" page (see [ML-17: Choose Circle or Coordinate List Entry](./ML-17.choose.circle.or.coordinate.list.entry.md))  
**AND** I have selected either radio button  
**WHEN** I select the "Continue" button  
**THEN** the "Which coordinate system do you want to use?" page is displayed:

- the page appears as per the prototype
- the project name will appear as the page caption
- the page contains explanatory text which can be expanded/collapsed

**NOTE** - see GOV.UK visually hidden style

### AC2 - validation

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Which coordinate system do you want to use?" page  
**AND** I have not selected a radio button on the page  
**WHEN** I select the "Continue" button  
**THEN** I will see an error message - "Select which coordinate system you want to use"

### AC3 - Continue

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Which coordinate system do you want to use?" page  
**AND** I have selected a radio button on the page  
**WHEN** I select the "Continue" button  
**THEN** I will remain on the same page (navigation to the next page will be covered by a separate story)  
**AND** the choice of coordinate system will be saved

### AC4 - Cancel

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Which coordinate system do you want to use?" page  
**WHEN** I select the "Cancel" option  
**THEN** I am returned to the task list

- the status of the task will not be updated
- the answers that I have provided so far will be discarded

### AC5 - Back

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Which coordinate system do you want to use?" page  
**WHEN** I select the "Back" option  
**THEN** I am taken to the previous page in the flow i.e. the "How do you want to enter the coordinates?" page (see [ML-17: Choose Circle or Coordinate List Entry](./ML-17.choose.circle.or.coordinate.list.entry.md))  
**AND** the answer that I previously chose on that page will be pre-selected
