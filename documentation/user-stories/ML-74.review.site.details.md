# ML-74: Review Site Details

## User Story

**AS** an applicant  
**I WANT** to review the details of the site that uploaded via file upload  
**SO THAT** I can confirm that everything is correct

## Background

Once the user has uploaded their site file, they will be able to review the details of their site. This page will have slightly different behaviour for other types of site such as circular site, and will also change once multiple sites is implemented.

## Resources

- Link to "Review site details" page prototype MVP - File upload version
- Link to data dictionary

## Out of Scope

This story does not cover the ability to make changes to any of the data from this page - the "Change" links will be added as part of a later story

This story does not include the "Map view" part of the summary card, the rendering of the site coordinates will be delivered under a separate ticket

This story does not cover the review of sites that have been provided by manual entry methods or drawing on a map

This story does not cover multiple sites behaviour

This story does not include an "Are you sure?" type validation message when the user clicks "Cancel"

This story does not cover the link for the survey in the header

This story does not cover the links in the footer

## Questions and Answers

## Screenshots

### Screenshot 1: Review site details page - KML file upload

**Page layout showing:**

- Standard GOV.UK header with "Get permission for a marine activity" service name
- Beta banner with feedback link
- Back link for navigation
- "Hammersmith pontoon project" displayed as page caption above the main heading
- "Review site details" as the main H1 heading
- Site details summary card containing:
  - **Method of providing site location**: "Upload a file with the coordinates of the site"
  - **File type**: "KML"
  - **File uploaded**: "coordinates.kml" (example filename with extension)
  - **Map view**: [Not implemented in this story - placeholder row]
- "Save and continue" button (green) and "Cancel" link positioned below the summary card
- Standard GOV.UK footer with licensing and regulatory information

### Screenshot 2: Review site details page - Shapefile upload

**Page layout showing:**

- Same overall layout as Screenshot 1
- Site details summary card with alternative file type display:
  - **Method of providing site location**: "Upload a file with the coordinates of the site"
  - **File type**: "Shapefile"
  - **File uploaded**: "site_boundaries.zip" (example shapefile package with extension)
  - **Map view**: [Not implemented in this story - placeholder row]
- Same navigation and action elements as Screenshot 1

**Note**: Change links shown in the prototype are not included in this implementation phase. Raw coordinate text block may be temporarily displayed for testing validation purposes.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1 - Display page

**GIVEN** I have uploaded a coordinate file (see https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-70)  
**WHEN** I select the "Continue" button  
**THEN** the "Review site details" page is displayed:

- the page appears as per the prototype (see exceptions to this in the next AC)
- the project name will appear as the page caption
- the page is populated with the details of the site that has just been provided

### AC2 - Summary card content

**GIVEN** I have uploaded a coordinate file  
**WHEN** I view the "Review site details" page  
**THEN** the summary card will contain the following details:

- **Method of providing site location** - populated with fixed text: "Upload a file with the coordinates of the site"
- **File type** - populated with either "KML" or "Shapefile", depending on what was uploaded
- **File uploaded** - populated with the name of the uploaded file, including the file extension e.g. "Hammersmith_coordinates.kml"
- **Map view** - the "Map view" row shown in the prototype will not be delivered as part of this story, it will be delivered as a separate ticket, subject to a spike for the map rendering

**NOTE** - the "Change" links shown in the prototype will not be delivered as part of this story, they will be delivered as a separate ticket

**NOTE** - it may be necessary/useful to temporarily display the raw coordinates from the uploaded file on the "Review site details" page as a text block, in order to support testing (i.e. allowing us to confirm that the coordinates that were in the file have been extracted successfully). Without doing this, we would not be able to fully verify the file upload was accurate until the map rendering ticket https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-68 was implemented (and even then, we could only 'eyeball' the map to see if it looks more or less right). Once the file upload has been verified as accurate it would be possible to remove this raw coordinate text block - this removal could be done as part of the map rendering ticket.

### AC3 - Save and continue

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Review site details" page  
**WHEN** I select the "Save and continue" option  
**THEN** the site information is saved to my notification  
**AND** I am returned to the task list  
**AND** the status of the "Site details" task is updated to "Completed"

### AC4 - Cancel

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Review site details" page  
**WHEN** I select the "Cancel" option  
**THEN** I am returned to the task list:

- the status of the task will not be updated
- the details of the site that I have provided so far will be discarded (including the uploaded file)

### AC5 - Back

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Review site details" page  
**WHEN** I select the "Back" option  
**THEN** I am taken to the previous page in the flow i.e. the "File upload" page (see https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-70)  
**AND** I will be able to choose another file

## Standard Behaviour

**"Back" link** - when I select the "Back" link (if present), I will be returned to the page I was on immediately prior to the current page. Any changes I made on the current page will be discarded.

**"Cancel" link** - when I select the "Cancel" link (if present) I will be returned to the task list. Any changes I made on the current page will be discarded.

**Displaying validation errors** - if any validation errors are triggered, they will be displayed in standard GDS format i.e. [error summary](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-summary/) at the top of the page, and [error message](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-message/) against the specific item that triggered the error. The wording of error messages should be verified against the data dictionary.
