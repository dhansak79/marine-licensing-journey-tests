# ML-75: FILE - Provide Dates for Multiple Sites

## User Story

**AS** an applicant  
**I WANT** to re-use the same set of activity dates for all my uploaded sites where appropriate  
**SO THAT** I do not have to keep re-entering the same dates

## Background

As part of the multiple sites work, it is necessary for the applicant to provide activity dates for each site they have uploaded for their notification. Previously, the user only had to provide dates for the notification as a whole.

In reality, where the uploaded file contains multiple sites, the dates will frequently be the same for all sites. In this case, the service will ask the user if they wish to re-use the same set of dates for all of their sites.

Note that the logic around re-using dates is slightly different for manually entered sites (circular sites and polygon sites) so that is covered under a separate story).

## Resources

## Out of Scope

Logic around re-using dates for manually entered sites (circular sites and polygon sites) is covered under a separate story

Navigation to the next page in the flow will be covered by a separate story

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1 - Display page

**GIVEN** I have successfully uploaded my coordinate file  
**AND** there is more than one site in the uploaded file  
**AND** I indicated that all my sites have the same activity dates (see https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-119)  
**WHEN** I select the "Continue" button on the "Are the activity dates the same for every site?" page  
**THEN** I will be taken to the "Activity dates" page to enter the dates for the sites

**NOTE** - if I indicated that my sites have different activity dates then I will not see this page

**NOTE** - if there is only one site in the uploaded file then I will not see this page

### AC2 - Page behaviour

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Activity dates" page  
**WHEN** the page is loaded  
**THEN** the page appears and behaves as per the prototype:

- the project name will appear as the page caption
- neither date is populated by default
- the page will have the following minor changes from the page built for https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-10:
  - First paragraph text refers to "Enter the activity dates for all sites." rather than "Enter the activity dates."
  - Call to action is "Continue" rather than "Save and continue"
- the date validation will continue to apply as per https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-10

**NOTE** - this page has already been built under and is currently being accessed directly from the task list at a 'notification' level. We are re-using the same page, with the same validation, but with the dates being specific to the site. There are minor changes to the content on the page as listed above, but the behaviour is the same

### AC3 - Continue

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Activity dates" page  
**AND** I have provided dates which pass the validation on the page  
**WHEN** I select the "Continue" button  
**THEN** I will remain on the same page (navigating to the next page will be covered in another story)

### AC4 - Cancel

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Activity dates" page as part of a file upload journey  
**WHEN** I select the "Cancel" option  
**THEN** I am returned to the task list:

- the status of the task will not be updated
- any answers that I have provided so far will be discarded
- any file I have uploaded will be discarded

### AC5 - Back

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Activity dates" page as part of a file upload journey  
**WHEN** I select the "Back" option  
**THEN** I am taken to the previous page in the flow i.e. the "Are the activity dates the same for every site?" page  
**AND** my previous answer is defaulted into the page

## Standard Behaviour

**"Back" link** - when I select the "Back" link (if present), I will be returned to the page I was on immediately prior to the current page. Any changes I made on the current page will be discarded.

**"Cancel" link** - when I select the "Cancel" link (if present) I will be returned to the task list. Any changes I made on the current page will be discarded.

**Displaying validation errors** - if any validation errors are triggered, they will be displayed in standard GDS format i.e. [error summary](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-summary/) at the top of the page, and [error message](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-message/) against the specific item that triggered the error. The wording of error messages should be verified against the data dictionary.
