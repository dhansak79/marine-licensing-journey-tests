# ML-812: Change survey URLs

## User Story

**AS** MMO  
**I WANT** to ensure that MMO has access to user survey responses  
**SO THAT** we can learn from user feedback

## Background

Qualtrix surveys are currently set up against Olesya's email address, but Olesya is now leaving the account, so we need to change the account which the surveys are linked to. A new email account - GetPermission.Feedback@marinemanagement.org.uk - is being set up, to be used as the account for surveys.

Once the new surveys are set up against this new account, this story will update the survey links within the "Get permission for marine work" service.

NOTE - the new surveys are going to be defined in MS Forms, rather than Qualtirx, due to ongoing concerns about future availability of the Qualtrix solution.
