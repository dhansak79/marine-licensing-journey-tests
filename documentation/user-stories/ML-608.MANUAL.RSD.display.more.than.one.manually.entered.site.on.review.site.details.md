# ML-608: MANUAL - RSD - Display More Than One Manually Entered Site on Review Site Details

## User Story

**AS** an applicant  
**I WANT** to review the details of all of the sites that I manually entered  
**SO THAT** I can confirm that everything is correct

## Background

This is an extension to https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-361, where we displayed the user's first site on the review site details page. Once the ability to 'add another site' is implemented (under https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-362) then we need to make some further updates to the "Review site details" page to display all the sites that have been added.

## Resources

- Link to "Review site details" page in multiple sites v2 prototype - manual entry route, two sites added - same dates, different description
- See comments for full set of prototype links for each scenario (links are too long to be stored in Jira description field)

## Out of Scope

- Navigation to the next page in the flow will be covered by a separate story
- This story does not cover the survey link and other links in the header
- This story does not cover the links in the footer

## Questions and Answers

TBC

**NOTE** - the content of each summary card will be as described in https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-361

## Standard Behaviour

**"Back" link** - when I select the "Back" link (if present), I will be returned to the page I was on immediately prior to the current page. Any changes I made on the current page will be discarded.

**"Cancel" link** - when I select the "Cancel" link (if present) I will be returned to the task list. Any changes I made on the current page will be discarded.

**Displaying validation errors** - if any validation errors are triggered, they will be displayed in standard GDS format i.e. [error summary](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-summary/) at the top of the page, and [error message](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-message/) against the specific item that triggered the error. The wording of error messages should be verified against the data dictionary.
