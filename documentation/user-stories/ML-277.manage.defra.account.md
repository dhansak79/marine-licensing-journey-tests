# ML-277: Manage Defra Account

## User Story

**AS** an applicant  
**I WANT** to be able to access my Defra account  
**SO THAT** I can manage the various aspects of my account from within the service

## Background

Integration with Defra Customer Identity allows services to make use of centrally-provided functionality to manage a user's account, and the services they are allowed to access. This story will add a link to the page header to allow users to access that account management functionality. Note that the account management page itself is provided by Defra Customer Identity, we do not need to build that page ourselves; we just link to it.

## Out of Scope

The Defra account management page itself is not provided by our service, and is out of scope for this story.

## Questions and Answers

**Q.** Should the Defra account page be opened in the same window or in a new window?

**A.** Confirmed with UX that it should remain within the same window

**Q.** Where should I go when I return from the Defra account management page?

**A.** They will be returned to the dashboard
