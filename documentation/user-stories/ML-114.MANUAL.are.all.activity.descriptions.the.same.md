# ML-114: MANUAL - Are All Activity Descriptions the Same?

## User Story

**AS** an applicant  
**I WANT** to re-use the same activity description for all my manually entered sites where appropriate  
**SO THAT** I do not have to keep re-entering the same description

## Background

As part of the multiple sites work, it may be necessary for the applicant to provide a description for each site they manually enter for their notification. Previously, the user only had to provide a description for the notification as a whole. As part of this story, the user will able to choose whether all of their sites should have the same description (i.e. re-use the same description), or whether they want to enter a separate description for each site. The entry of the description itself is covered under https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-421.

Note that the logic around re-using the description is slightly different for uploaded sites, so that is covered under a separate story.

## Resources

- Link to "Is the activity description the same for every site?" page in multiple sites prototype v2 (MANUAL ENTRY VERSION)

## Out of Scope

- Logic around re-using descriptions for uploaded sites is covered under a separate story (https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-120)
- Navigation to the next page in the flow will be covered by a separate story
- This story does not cover the survey link and other links in the header
- This story does not cover the links in the footer

## Questions and Answers

TBC

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1 - Display page

**GIVEN** I am providing more than one site via manual entry  
**WHEN** I select the "Continue" button on the "Activity dates" page - see https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-420)  
**THEN** the "Is the activity description the same for every site?" page is displayed

### AC2 - Page behaviour

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Is the activity description the same for every site?" page (as per AC1)  
**WHEN** the page is loaded  
**THEN** the page appears as per the prototype  
**AND** the project name will appear as the page caption  
**AND** neither radio button is selected by default

### AC3 - Validation

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Is the activity description the same for every site?" page  
**AND** I have not selected a radio button on the page  
**WHEN** I select the "Continue" button  
**THEN** I will see an error message - "Select whether the activity description is the same for every site"

### AC4 - Continue

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Is the activity description the same for every site?" page  
**AND** I have selected either radio button on the page  
**WHEN** I select the "Continue" button  
**THEN** I will be taken to the "How do you want to enter the site coordinates?" page (existing page where I will be able to choose between entering a circular site and a polygon site)

**NOTE** - this is temporary routing to ensure that the journey is not broken. The routing will be updated once https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-421 is implemented

### AC5 - Cancel

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Is the activity description the same for every site?" page  
**WHEN** I select the "Cancel" option  
**THEN** I am returned to the task list:

- the status of the task will not be updated
- any answers that I have provided so far will be discarded

### AC6 - Back

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Is the activity description the same for every site?" page as part of a manual entry journey  
**WHEN** I select the "Back" option  
**THEN** I am taken to the previous page in the flow i.e. the "Activity dates" page  
**AND** my previous answers on that page are defaulted in as expected

## Standard Behaviour

**"Back" link** - when I select the "Back" link (if present), I will be returned to the page I was on immediately prior to the current page. Any changes I made on the current page will be discarded.

**"Cancel" link** - when I select the "Cancel" link (if present) I will be returned to the task list. Any changes I made on the current page will be discarded.

**Displaying validation errors** - if any validation errors are triggered, they will be displayed in standard GDS format i.e. [error summary](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-summary/) at the top of the page, and [error message](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-message/) against the specific item that triggered the error. The wording of error messages should be verified against the data dictionary.
