# ML-20: Page Header

## User Story

**AS** an applicant  
**I WANT** to see a header with a clear identity and useful links at the top of every page  
**SO THAT** I know I am in the right place and I can quickly navigate to important pages

## Background

Our pages need to comply with the GDS standard header template.

## Resources

- [GOV.UK header â€“ GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/header/)
- Project name start page prototype

## Out of Scope

This is just to provide the header content - not the content of the pages linked from it.

The beta banner is handled by https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-302

## Questions and Answers

TBC

## Screenshots

### Screenshot 1: Standard Page Header with Navigation

**Page layout showing:**

- **GOV.UK Crown Logo**: Standard black crown logo positioned in the top left corner with "GOV.UK" text, linking to the main GOV.UK homepage
- **Service Header**: Blue service navigation bar containing:
  - **Service Name**: "Get permission for marine work" displayed prominently as the main service identifier
  - **Navigation Links**: Right-aligned navigation area containing:
    - "Projects" link for accessing the user's project dashboard
    - "Defra account" link for managing account settings and details
    - "Sign out" link for securely logging out of the service
- **Beta Banner**: Standard GOV.UK beta phase banner positioned below the header, indicating "This is a new service. Help us improve it and give your feedback (opens in new tab)." with an underlined feedback link
- **Consistent Styling**: Blue header background (#1d70b8) following GOV.UK design system colour palette and typography standards
- **Responsive Design**: Header elements that adapt appropriately across different screen sizes and devices
- **Accessibility Features**: Proper semantic HTML structure with appropriate ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support

The header demonstrates full compliance with GDS standards while providing clear service identity and essential navigation functionality for authenticated users.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1 - Main header details

**GIVEN** I am accessing the MPLP service  
**WHEN** any pages load  
**THEN** display a GDS-compliant header with:

- a link to the Projects home page
- a link to the applicant's Defra ID account
- a link to sign out of the service

### AC2 - Do not show full header on Project Name Start page

**GIVEN** I have logged in after the IAT journey  
**WHEN** I am on the Project Name Start Page  
**THEN** do not show the header links

We want the user to click Save and Continue so the draft application is created, rather than leaving without a draft being created.

## Standard Behaviour

**GOV.UK Crown Logo** - when I select the crown logo, I will be taken to the main GOV.UK homepage (https://www.gov.uk/).

**Service Name Link** - when I select the service name "Get permission for marine work", I will be taken to the service homepage or dashboard.

**Projects Link** - when I select the "Projects" link, I will be taken to the dashboard showing all my marine licensing projects.

**Defra Account Link** - when I select the "Defra account" link, I will be taken to the Defra ID account management page where I can manage my account details and settings.

**Sign Out Link** - when I select the "Sign out" link, I will be securely logged out of the service and redirected to an appropriate sign-out confirmation page.

**Accessibility** - all header navigation elements will be keyboard accessible and include appropriate ARIA labels for screen readers.

**Responsive Design** - the header will adapt appropriately for different screen sizes, with navigation potentially collapsing to a menu on smaller devices.
