# ML-674: CYA - Display "Purpose of the activity" in the Project Summary Card

## User Story

**AS** an applicant  
**I WANT** to see the purpose of the activity (as defined by the legislation)  
**SO THAT** I can understand the activity as MMO will understand it

## Background

Displaying the purpose of the activity was split from story https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-142 as there was still some outstanding questions about the logic used to populate it. This story now implements the logic to display the purpose of the activity (based on the activity type and article number received from Fivium as per https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-111.

## Resources

- "Check your answers" page showing purpose of activity in multiple sites prototype v2

This story does not cover the Change link in the "Project summary" card

This story does not cover the survey link and other links in the header

This story does not cover the links in the footer

## Questions and Answers

## Screenshots

### Screenshot 1: Check Your Answers Page with Purpose of Activity in Project Summary Card

**Page layout showing:**

- Standard GOV.UK header with "Get permission for marine work" service name
- Beta banner with feedback link indicating "This is a new service. Help us improve it and give your feedback (opens in new tab)."
- Back link for navigation to return to the previous page
- "South coast sea samples" displayed as the project name caption above the main heading
- "Check your answers before sending your information" as the main H1 heading
- **Project summary card** (focus of this story) containing:
  - **Project name**: "South coast sea samples"
  - **Type of activity**: "Removal of a substance or object"
  - **The purpose of the activity**: "Samples for testing and analysis" (new field added in this story)
  - **Why this activity is exempt**: "Based on your answers from 'Check if you need a marine licence', your activity is exempt under Article 17A of the Marine Licensing (Exempted Activities) Order 2011 (opens in new tab)"
  - **Your answers from 'Check if you need a marine licence'**: "Download a copy of your answers (PDF)"
- Guidance text at bottom of card: "If you need to change any of your 'Check if you need a marine licence' answers: 1. Delete this project from the Projects page. 2. Select 'Create new project' to start again."
- Standard GOV.UK footer with licensing and regulatory information

The screenshot demonstrates the addition of the "Purpose of the activity" row within the existing Project summary card, positioned between "Type of activity" and "Why this activity is exempt" rows.

## Standard Behaviour

**"Back" link** - when I select the "Back" link (if present), I will be returned to the page I was on immediately prior to the current page. Any changes I made on the current page will be discarded.

**"Cancel" link** - when I select the "Cancel" link (if present) I will be returned to the task list. Any changes I made on the current page will be discarded.

**Displaying validation errors** - if any validation errors are triggered, they will be displayed in standard GDS format i.e. [error summary](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-summary/) at the top of the page, and [error message](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-message/) against the specific item that triggered the error. The wording of error messages should be verified against the data dictionary.
