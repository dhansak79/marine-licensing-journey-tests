# ML-145: Link to Public Register from Public Register Consent Page

## User Story

**AS** an applicant  
**I WANT** to be able to view the public register when providing consent to share  
**SO THAT** I can understand how my information may be shared

## Background

In https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-12, the initial story to gather consent to share on the public register, the link to the live public register was not included. This is because the URL was not known at the time, since we were not sure whether the public register would be replaced.

This story is to implement the link to the existing live public register on the "Public register consent" page.

## Resources

- Link to "Public register consent" page
- [Marine Management Organisation Public Register](https://marinelicensing.marinemanagement.org.uk/mmo/fox/live/MMO_PUBLIC_REGISTER)

### Screenshot 1: Public Register Consent Page with Link

**Page layout showing:**

- Standard GOV.UK header with crown logo and "GOV.UK" branding
- Blue service header containing "Get permission for marine work" as the service name
- Navigation area on the right side of the service header containing "Projects", "Defra account", and "Sign out" links
- Beta banner with blue background stating "This is a new service. Help us improve it and give your feedback (opens in new tab)." with an underlined feedback link
- Back link (with left arrow) for navigation to return to the previous page
- "South coast sea samples" displayed as the project name caption above the main heading
- "Public register" as the main H1 heading in large, bold text
- Explanatory paragraph text: "The Marine Management Organisation publishes information about marine licence applications and exemptions on a public register (opens in new tab)."
- Radio button question: "Do you believe the information you have provided should be withheld from the public register?"
- Two radio button options:
  - "Yes" option (not selected)
  - "No" option (not selected)
- "Save and continue" button with green background positioned below the radio buttons
- "Cancel" link in blue text positioned to the right of the Save and continue button
- Standard GOV.UK footer with licensing and regulatory information

**Key feature:** The text "public register (opens in new tab)" appears as an underlined hyperlink within the explanatory paragraph, providing direct access to the live MMO public register for users to review before making their consent decision.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1 - Public register URL

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Public register consent" page (see https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-12)  
**WHEN** I select the "public register (opens in new tab)" link  
**THEN** I am taken to the following URL - https://marinelicensing.marinemanagement.org.uk/mmo/fox/live/MMO_PUBLIC_REGISTER  
**AND** the page is opened in a new tab

## Standard Behaviour

**External link behaviour** - when I select the "public register (opens in new tab)" link, the Marine Management Organisation's public register will open in a new browser tab, allowing me to review existing published information while maintaining my current position in the marine licensing application.

**Link accessibility** - the link will include appropriate accessibility attributes such as `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"` for security, and will be clearly identified as opening in a new tab for screen reader users.

**Context preservation** - opening the public register in a new tab ensures that users can review published information without losing their progress in the current application form.

**Link styling** - the link will follow GOV.UK design system standards with appropriate underline styling and colour contrast to ensure it is clearly identifiable as a clickable link within the paragraph text.
