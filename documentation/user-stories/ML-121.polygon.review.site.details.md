# ML-121: Review Polygon Site Details

## User Story

**AS** an applicant  
**I WANT** to review the details of the site that I added manually by providing multiple sets of coordinates  
**SO THAT** I can confirm that everything is correct

## Background

Once the user has manually provided the details of their polygon site via a list of coordinates, they will be able to review the details of their site. The behaviour defined in this story builds upon the "Review site details" page for a circular site, see https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-37.

Depending on the order in which tickets are delivered, this page may also have to display any additional points that may have been added via the "Add another point" button (see https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-38).

## Resources

- Link to "Review site details" page prototype MVP - Multiple coordinates version
- Link to data dictionary

## Out of scope

This story does not include the "Map view" part of the summary card, the rendering of the site coordinates onto a map will be delivered under a separate ticket

This story does not cover the review of sites that have been provided via circle centre and width, file upload or drawing on a map

Navigation to the next page in the flow will be covered by a separate story

This story does not cover the survey and other links in the header

This story does not cover the links in the footer

## Questions and answers

TBC

**Page layout showing:**

- Same overall layout as Screenshot 1
- Site details summary card with alternative coordinate system display:
  - **Method of providing site location**: "Manually enter multiple sets of coordinates to mark the boundary of the site"
  - **Coordinate system**: "OSGB36 (National Grid) Eastings and Northings"
  - **Start and end points**: "123456, 987654" (example coordinates in eastings, northings format)
  - **Point 2**: "234567, 876543"
  - **Point 3**: "345678, 765432"
  - **Map view**: [Not implemented in this story - placeholder row]
- Same navigation and action elements as Screenshot 1

### Screenshot 3: Review site details page - Multiple additional points

**Page layout showing:**

- Same overall layout as previous screenshots
- Site details summary card with extended coordinate list demonstrating additional points:
  - **Method of providing site location**: "Manually enter multiple sets of coordinates to mark the boundary of the site"
  - **Coordinate system**: "WGS84 (World Geodetic System 1984) Latitude and longitude"
  - **Start and end points**: "55.123456, 55.123456"
  - **Point 2**: "33.987654, 33.987654"
  - **Point 3**: "78.123456, 78.123456"
  - **Point 4**: "45.678901, 45.678901"
  - **Point 5**: "56.789012, 56.789012"
  - **Map view**: [Not implemented in this story - placeholder row]
- Demonstrates the flexible display of multiple coordinate points as added via ML-38 functionality

**Note**: Change links shown in the prototype are not included in this implementation phase

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1 - Display page

**GIVEN** I have provided the details of my polygon site manually by adding multiple sets of coordinates (see https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-19)  
**WHEN** I select the "Continue" button  
**THEN** the "Review site details" page is displayed (see https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-37)  
**AND** the page is populated with the details of the polygon site that I have just defined (see next AC)

### AC2 - Summary card content (multiple coordinates version)

**GIVEN** I have provided a list of coordinates for my polygon site  
**WHEN** I view the "Review site details" page  
**THEN** the summary card will contain the following details:

- **Method of providing site location** - populated with fixed text: "Manually enter multiple sets of coordinates to mark the boundary of the site"
- **Coordinate system** - populated with the chosen coordinate system, display either:
  - "WGS84 (World Geodetic System 1984) Latitude and longitude" OR
  - "OSGB36 (National Grid) Eastings and Northings"
- **Start and end points** - populated with the start/end point coordinates, display either:
  - "\<latitude\>, \<longitude\>" OR
  - "\<eastings\>, \<northings\>"
- **Points 2..n** - populated with a row for each set of coordinates from point 2 to point n, based on how many sets of coordinates have been added. For each row, display either:
  - "\<latitude\>, \<longitude\>" OR
  - "\<eastings\>, \<northings\>"

**NOTE** - the "Change" links shown in the prototype will not be delivered as part of this story, they will be delivered as a separate ticket

**NOTE** - the "Map view" row shown in the prototype will not be delivered as part of this story, it will be delivered as a separate ticket, subject to a spike for the map rendering

### AC3 - Save and continue

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Review site details" page for my polygon site  
**WHEN** I select the "Save and continue" option  
**THEN** the site information is saved to my notification  
**AND** I am returned to the task list  
**AND** the status of the "Site details" task is updated to "Completed"

### AC4 - Cancel

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Review site details" page for my polygon site  
**WHEN** I select the "Cancel" option  
**THEN** I am returned to the task list:

- the status of the task will not be updated
- the details of the site that I have provided so far will be discarded

### AC5 - Back

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Review site details" page for my polygon site  
**WHEN** I select the "Back" option  
**THEN** I am taken to the previous page in the flow i.e. the "Enter multiple sets of coordinates to mark the boundary of the site" page (see https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-19 and https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-38)  
**AND** the answers that I previously provided on that page will be pre-populated

## Standard Behaviour

**"Back" link** - when I select the "Back" link (if present), I will be returned to the page I was on immediately prior to the current page. Any changes I made on the current page will be discarded.

**"Cancel" link** - when I select the "Cancel" link (if present) I will be returned to the task list. Any changes I made on the current page will be discarded.

**Displaying validation errors** - if any validation errors are triggered, they will be displayed in standard GDS format i.e. [error summary](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-summary/) at the top of the page, and [error message](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-message/) against the specific item that triggered the error. The wording of error messages should be verified against the data dictionary.
