# ML-82: Check answers before sending your information

## User Story

**AS** an applicant  
**I WANT** to see the answers I have provided  
**SO THAT** I can check everything is correct before I submit my notification

## Background

Once the user has completed all the tasks on the task list, they will be able to access the "Check your answers" page, which will play back all their answers and allow them to verify that the answers are OK, ready for submission of their notification.

It is worth noting that whilst this page is initially being built in the context of a notification with a circular site, the majority of the content and behaviour of the page (effectively everything apart from the "Site details" card) is also applicable for notifications with other types of site (such as polygon or file upload).

## Resources

- Link to "Check your answers" page in prototype MVP - circular site version

## Out of Scope

This story does not cover the ability to make changes to any information on the "Check your answers" page (via the "Change" links)

This story does not include the following content in the "Activity details" summary card:

- The type of activity, the purpose of activity and what the activity involves
- link to the downloadable PDF of answer from IAT
- the link to "your projects"
- the link to "checking if you need a marine licence"
- the link to the article under which the activity is exempt

This story does not cover the submission of the notification (i.e. the behaviour of the "Confirm and send" button)

This story does not cover the "Check your answers" page when the site has been added via the multiple coordinates page, or the file upload process

This story does not cover the map view of the site

This story does not cover any additional validation required at the point of submission, such as checking that the dates are still valid

## Screenshots

## Standard Behaviour

**"Go back to your project" link** - when I select the "Go back to your project" link, I will be returned to the task list. Any changes I made on the current page will be discarded.

**Displaying validation errors** - if any validation errors are triggered, they will be displayed in standard GDS format i.e. [error summary](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-summary/) at the top of the page, and [error message](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-message/) against the specific item that triggered the error. The wording of error messages should be verified against the data dictionary.
