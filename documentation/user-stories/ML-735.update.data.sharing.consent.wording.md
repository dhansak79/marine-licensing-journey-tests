# ML-735: Update Data Sharing Consent Wording

## User Story

**AS** an applicant  
**I WANT** to permit or forbid my data from being made available to the public register  
**SO THAT** I can control if my marine site is made public

## Background

The public register question needs to be updated with clearer language to make it clearer to the applicant what is going on and why it is important that we publish their data. The wording around consent is being made more generalised, from previously just talking about sharing on the public register to more general public sharing.

In addition, the previous implementation of this page asked if the user wished to withhold consent to sharing (in this case, "No" was the answer which provides consent). This is now being flipped, asking the user if they wish to provide consent to sharing (in this case, "Yes" is the answer which would provides consent).

This story updates the consent page itself, and other pages in the journey which refer to consent to sharing.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1 - Update Link on Task List

**GIVEN** I am viewing the task list  
**WHEN** I look at the "Public register" task  
**THEN** I see that the task has been re-labelled to "Sharing your project information publicly"  
**AND** the behaviour of the task link itself is unchanged

### AC2 - Update Page Content

**GIVEN** I have clicked the "Sharing your project information publicly" task list (as defined in the previous AC)  
**WHEN** I am taken to the page to manage my consent  
**THEN** I see that the page is updated as per the prototype:

- The page heading (H1) is updated
- The page text is updated
- The question text is updated
- The radio button labels are updated
- The associated error messages are updated:
  - No option selected - "Select whether you consent to the MMO publishing your project information publicly"
  - Input box left blank - "Provide details of why you do not consent to your project information being published"

**NOTE** - the previous implementation of this page asked if the user wished to withhold consent to sharing - in this case, "No" was the answer which provides consent. The wording of the question has now been reversed, asking the user if they wish to provide consent to sharing - in this case, "Yes" is the answer which would provides consent. This reversal in the meaning of the answers "Yes" and "No" should not provide any issues with existing data, since we do not have any live exemptions yet. As such there is no need for any data transformation.

### AC3 - Update "Check Your Answers" Page Content

**GIVEN** I have provided all information for the notification (including the updated consent information)  
**WHEN** I view the "Check your answers" page  
**THEN** I see that the summary card for sharing consent is updated as per the prototype:

- The summary card heading is updated
- The question labels on the individual rows are updated

**NOTE** - the behaviour of the "Change" link is not within the scope of this ticket, but the changes defined are cosmetic only, and would not affect the "Change" link behaviour
