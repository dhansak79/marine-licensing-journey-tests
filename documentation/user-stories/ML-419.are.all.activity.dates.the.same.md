# ML-419: Are All Activity Dates the Same?

## User Story

**AS** an applicant  
**I WANT** to re-use the same set of activity dates for all my manually input sites where appropriate  
**SO THAT** I can efficiently provide the same dates without having to enter them multiple times

## Background

As part of the multiple sites work, it is necessary for the applicant to provide a set of activity dates for each site they have manually input for their exemption notification. Previously, the user only had to provide dates for the exemption notification as a whole.

In reality, where multiple sites are manually input, the dates will frequently be the same for all sites. In this case, the service will ask the user if they wish to re-use the same set of dates for all of their sites.

Note that the logic around re-using dates is slightly different for uploaded sites so that is covered under [ML-119](https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-119).

## Resources

- Link to "Are the activity dates the same for every site?" page in prototype
- Prototype - https://app.mural.co/t/defraallcompany8330/m/defraallcompany8330/1736454808160/e9f5619d6289abecef4ad6c0ff622d1802e4d8b1

## Out of Scope

- Logic around re-using dates for uploaded sites is covered under [ML-119](https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-119)
- Navigation to the next pages in the flow will be covered by a separate story
- This story does not cover the survey link and other links in the header
- This story does not cover the links in the footer

## Screenshots

### Screenshot 1: Are the Activity Dates the Same Page

**Page layout showing:**

- Standard GOV.UK header with "Get permission for marine work" service name
- Beta banner with feedback link
- Back link for navigation
- Project name displayed as page caption above the main heading
- "Are the activity dates the same for every site?" as the main H1 heading
- Two radio button options:
  1. "Yes, the dates are the same for every site" with helper text "You'll only need to enter the dates once"
  2. "No, at least one site has different dates" with helper text "You'll need to enter dates for each site"
- "Continue" button (green) and "Cancel" link positioned below the radio buttons
- Standard GOV.UK footer with licensing and regulatory information

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1 - Display page

**GIVEN** I have chosen to manually add more than one site on the "Do you need to tell us about more than one site?" page (as per [ML-227](https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-227))  
**WHEN** I continue from the "Site name" page (see [ML-228](https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-228))  
**THEN** the "Are the activity dates the same for every site?" page is displayed

### AC2 - Page behaviour

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Are the activity dates the same for every site?" page (as per AC1)  
**WHEN** the page is loaded  
**THEN** the page appears as per the prototype  
**AND** the project name will appear as the page caption  
**AND** neither radio button is selected by default

### AC3 - Validation

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Are the activity dates the same for every site?" page  
**AND** I have not selected a radio button on the page  
**WHEN** I select the "Continue" button  
**THEN** I will see an error message - "Select whether the activity dates are the same for every site"

**NOTE** - this is not in the prototype

### AC4 - Continue

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Are the activity dates the same for every site?" page  
**AND** I have selected either radio button on the page  
**WHEN** I select the "Continue" button  
**THEN** continue to the Enter activity dates page

### AC5 - Cancel

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Are the activity dates the same for every site?" page  
**WHEN** I select the "Cancel" option  
**THEN** I am returned to the task list:

- the status of the task will not be updated
- any answers that I have provided so far will be discarded

### AC6 - Back

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Are the activity dates the same for every site?" page  
**WHEN** I select the "Back" option  
**THEN** I am taken to the previous page in the flow i.e. the site name page  
**AND** my previous answer is defaulted into the page

## Standard Behaviour

**"Back" link** - when I select the "Back" link (if present), I will be returned to the page I was on immediately prior to the current page. Any changes I made on the current page will be discarded.

**"Cancel" link** - when I select the "Cancel" link (if present) I will be returned to the task list. Any changes I made on the current page will be discarded.

**Displaying validation errors** - if any validation errors are triggered, they will be displayed in standard GDS format i.e. [error summary](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-summary/) at the top of the page, and [error message](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-message/) against the specific item that triggered the error. The wording of error messages should be verified against the data dictionary.
