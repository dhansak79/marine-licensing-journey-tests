# ML-12: Provide or Withhold Public Register Content

## User Story

**AS** an applicant  
**I WANT** to state whether I consent for my marine project to be shared on the public register  
**SO THAT** my notification will only be shared if I consent

## Background

MMO would like to share all exemption notifications to the public register (a publicly available list of all marine-licensable activities). Exemption notifications are not currently shared. In order to support this sharing in future, we need to ask the user if they are happy for their details to be shared, and if not, ask them why not.

## Resources

## Out of Scope

This story does not actually share the application details to the public register - that will be done under another story.

This story does not cover the link to the public register.

This story does not cover the link for the survey in the header.

This story does not cover the links in the footer.

Character count is currently out of scope for this ticket, but could be added separately later if needed.

Minimum character count is out of scope for this ticket but could be added later if needed, to prevent users from just adding "." or similar.

## Questions and Answers

**Q.** How much text should we allow in the reason text field?

**A.** Decision in refinement session to go with 1000 characters. We can check against Fivium DB to see if any of the existing notifications have more than 1000 characters.

## Screenshots

**Public register page showing:**
