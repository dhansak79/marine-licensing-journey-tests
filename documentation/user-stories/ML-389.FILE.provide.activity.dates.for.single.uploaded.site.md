# ML-389: FILE - Provide Activity Dates for a Single Uploaded Site

## User Story

**AS** an applicant  
**I WANT** to provide activity dates for a single uploaded site  
**SO THAT** I can inform MMO of when my activity will take place at the site

## Background

As part of the multiple sites work, it is necessary for the applicant to provide activity dates for each site they have uploaded for their notification. Previously, the user only had to provide dates for the notification as a whole.

In the case where there is only a single site in the uploaded file, we do not need to ask the user if the dates are the same for all sites; we just proceed straight to asking them for the dates.

Note that the logic around re-using dates is slightly different for manually entered sites (circular sites and polygon sites) so that is covered under a separate story.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1 - Display page

**GIVEN** I have successfully uploaded my coordinate file  
**AND** my file contains a single site  
**WHEN** I select the "Continue" button on the "File upload" page  
**THEN** I will be taken to the "Activity dates" page to enter the dates for the single site

### AC2 - Page behaviour

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Activity dates" page for a single uploaded site  
**WHEN** the page is loaded  
**THEN** the page appears and behaves as per the prototype:

- the project name will appear as the page caption
- neither date field is populated by default
- the date validation will continue to apply as per https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/ML-10

### AC3 - Continue

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Activity dates" page for a single uploaded site  
**AND** I have provided dates which pass the validation on the page  
**WHEN** I select the "Continue" button  
**THEN** I will be taken to the "Review site details" page

**NOTE** - this navigation directly to the "Review site details" page is temporary to maintain a navigable file upload journey whilst the rest of the multiple sites functionality is under construction

### AC4 - Cancel

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Activity dates" page for a single uploaded site  
**WHEN** I select the "Cancel" option  
**THEN** I am returned to the task list:

- the status of the task will not be updated
- any answers that I have provided so far will be discarded
- any file I have uploaded will be discarded

### AC5 - Back

**GIVEN** I am viewing the "Activity dates" page for a single uploaded site  
**WHEN** I select the "Back" option  
**THEN** I am taken to the previous page in the flow i.e. the "File upload" page  
**AND** my previous answer is defaulted into the page

## Standard Behaviour

**"Back" link** - when I select the "Back" link (if present), I will be returned to the page I was on immediately prior to the current page. Any changes I made on the current page will be discarded.

**"Cancel" link** - when I select the "Cancel" link (if present) I will be returned to the task list. Any changes I made on the current page will be discarded.

**Displaying validation errors** - if any validation errors are triggered, they will be displayed in standard GDS format i.e. [error summary](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-summary/) at the top of the page, and [error message](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-message/) against the specific item that triggered the error. The wording of error messages should be verified against the data dictionary.
