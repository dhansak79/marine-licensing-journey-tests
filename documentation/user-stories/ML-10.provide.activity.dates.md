# ML-10: Provide Activity Dates

## User Story

**AS** an applicant
**I WANT** to provide the activity dates for my marine project
**SO THAT** I can inform MMO when my activity will take place

## Background

TBC

## Resources

Link to "Activity dates" page in prototype MVP

Link to data dictionary

## Out of scope

There is a scenario where it is acceptable for dates to be provided retrospectively, in the case of emergency works. This applies to one article only. When we get the article and other contextual information from Fivium, we will be able to manage the validation to cater for this scenario, but it is out of scope for this ticket.

There will be a separate ticket to cover an additional check on the dates to ensure they are still appropriate at the point of submission. That validation is not covered in this story

This story does not cover the link for the survey in the header

This story does not cover the links in the footer

## Questions and answers

**Q.** Do we need to validate that the date is not more than 1 year in future? Is this a hard rule?
**A.** TBC - can be added as a separate ticket later.

**Q.** Can we do dynamic hint text, so that the date is always a sensible amount of time in the future?
**A.** - If this is needed we can do it as a separate ticket
