## Role & Context

**Role**: Enforcement Officer & Regional Administrative Coordinator  
**Organisation**: MMO Coastal Team, South East region  
**Dual Responsibility**: 50% field enforcement, 50% marine licensing admin (2 hours/week workbasket management)

### Daily Reality

Rachel works as an enforcement officer but also manages regional workbasket distribution for her team. She oversees marine activities from "Lymington to the Thames tidal reaches" with 456 licensed projects and only 3 'warranted' officers to enforce marine activity.

**Key Responsibilities:**

- Field enforcement and marine activity monitoring
- Regional workbasket management and distribution
- License and exemption case assignment
- Team coordination based on geographic proximity

### Key Challenges

- **Mixed Workload Management**: "Exemptions and license cases mixed up with own assigned workload in one basket which is hard for her to manage"
- **Manual Assignment Process**: "Assigns out all licenses and exemptions to workbaskets of individuals based on proximity to proposed activity"
- **Risk vs. Opportunity**: "Often prioritise opportunistically rather than on risk" due to time constraints
- **System Limitations**: "Over 100 licenses in basket... challenges and time constraints"

## Core Needs

1. **Workload Separation**:

   - Clear distinction between personal enforcement cases and administrative assignments
   - Separate views for regional coordination vs. individual work
   - Efficient case distribution workflows

2. **Geographic Intelligence**:

   - Location-based assignment tools
   - Understanding of team member expertise and proximity
   - Regional boundary management

3. **Priority Management**:

   - Risk-based prioritisation tools instead of opportunistic scheduling
   - Clear indicators of case urgency and complexity
   - Workload balancing across team members

4. **Notification Systems**:
   - Automated alerts for new assignments
   - Status updates on case progress
   - Communication tools for team coordination

## Behavioral Patterns

### Administrative Approach

- **Geographic logic**: Assigns work "based on proximity to proposed activity"
- **Team knowledge**: Understands individual expertise and availability
- **Process awareness**: "She believes they are spot checked by marine licensing team first"

### Field Operations

- **Enforcement focus**: Inspecting marine activities and ensuring compliance
- **Mobile requirements**: Field work requires different tools than office administration
- **Training maintenance**: "Undergo training and certification before exercising enforcement powers"

### System Adaptation

- **Workaround creation**: "Create off system workarounds" due to MCMS limitations
- **Manual processes**: Significant manual work in case assignment and tracking
- **Efficiency seeking**: Looking for ways to streamline dual responsibilities

## Testing Implications

### Critical Scenarios

- **Workbasket management workflows**: Efficient distribution of regional cases
- **Field-to-office transitions**: Moving between enforcement and administrative work
- **Team coordination interfaces**: Assigning work based on expertise and location
- **Priority assessment tools**: Risk-based case prioritisation

### UX Requirements

- **Role switching**: Clear transitions between enforcement and admin functions
- **Geographic visualization**: Maps and location-based assignment tools
- **Workload dashboards**: Team overview and individual case management
- **Mobile optimisation**: Field-friendly interfaces for enforcement work

### Edge Cases

- **Regional misassignment**: Cases going to wrong geographic areas
- **Workload imbalance**: When team members have uneven case distributions
- **Urgent case handling**: Emergency or high-priority case workflows
- **Cross-boundary coordination**: Cases spanning multiple regional areas

## Persona Background

Rachel represents the dual nature of many MMO field staff who balance enforcement activities with administrative responsibilities. Her coordinator role gives her visibility into both individual case work and team-level operations.

Her enforcement background provides practical understanding of what makes cases feasible to handle in the field, while her administrative role requires efficiency in managing workflows for the entire regional team.

The tension between her two roles highlights system limitations that force manual workarounds and suboptimal prioritisation strategies.

## Research Quotes

- _"Works as an enforcement officer but also takes a part time (2hr per week) administrative role managing the workbaskets of their regional team"_
- _"All of these exemptions and license cases are then mixed up with her own assigned workload in one basket which is hard for her to manage"_
- _"She assigns out all of the licenses and exemptions to the workbaskets of individuals in her team based on their proximity to the proposed activity"_
- _"They often prioritise opportunistically rather than on risk... due to challenges and time constraints"_

## System Pain Points

### Workbasket Confusion

The mixing of personal and administrative work creates cognitive load and management complexity. Rachel needs to switch between thinking about her own cases and distributing team work.

### Manual Assignment Process

Geographic assignment based on proximity requires manual assessment and knowledge of team member locations and expertise. This creates potential for errors and inefficiencies.

### Prioritisation Challenges

Without proper risk assessment tools, teams resort to "opportunistic" prioritisation, which may not align with regulatory priorities or public safety concerns.

### Limited Notification Systems

The research indicates poor visibility into case status changes and new assignments, forcing manual checking and follow-up processes.
