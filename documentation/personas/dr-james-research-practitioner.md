## Role & Context

**Role**: University Research Scientist  
**Organisation**: Marine research institution, environmental consultancy  
**Focus**: Scientific sampling, marine research projects requiring regulatory permissions

### Daily Reality

Dr. James conducts marine research that requires various forms of licensing and exemption notifications. His work involves careful documentation and regulatory compliance for research activities, from simple sampling to complex multi-site studies.

**Typical Research Activities:**

- Sediment sampling for environmental research
- Scientific instrument deployment
- Marine ecosystem studies
- Environmental impact assessments

### Key Challenges

- **Documentation Preparation**: "250 words or something like that. Is there a character or word limit?"
- **Technical Categorisation**: "This is a funny one, I will usually pick removal – its only semantics"
- **Regulatory Uncertainty**: "A little ambiguous... Am I taking a sample from a wreck rather than am I in a boat"
- **Professional Caution**: "Would do due diligence before answering... speak to harbour commissioners"

## Core Needs

1. **Research Context Communication**:
   - Clear word/character limits for descriptions
   - Ability to provide research justification and methodology
   - Context about research objectives and intended findings

2. **Technical Accuracy**:
   - Precise activity categorisation that matches research activities
   - Clear definitions that distinguish between similar activities
   - Understanding of regulatory boundaries for research

3. **Professional Validation**:
   - Confirmation tools to verify regulatory compliance
   - Access to guidance that validates research approach
   - Professional due diligence capabilities

4. **Documentation Standards**:
   - Academic-level documentation requirements
   - Research methodology descriptions
   - Scientific rigor in application process

## Behavioural Patterns

### Preparation Approach

- **Documentation ready**: "I would have a summary doc to copy from which would give context of the research"
- **Professional thoroughness**: Research background leads to detailed guidance reading
- **Technical competence**: "I've worked with ArcGIS which would give you points"

### Validation Seeking

- **Guidance confirmation**: "As a person with research background I would spend more time reading the guidance"
- **Professional verification**: Uses checker "to confirm" rather than for discovery
- **Due diligence**: "Would do due diligence before answering"

### Technical Interaction

- **GIS familiarity**: Comfortable with ArcGIS and coordinate systems
- **Scientific precision**: "If its a single sample site I'd probably just enter the point of the sample site"
- **Methodological clarity**: Seeks clear categorisation that matches research methods

## Testing Implications

### Critical Scenarios

- **Research description workflows**: How to communicate research context effectively
- **Activity categorisation for research**: Ensuring scientific activities map correctly
- **Multi-site research projects**: Coordinating permissions across study areas
- **Technical documentation submission**: Handling research methodologies and justifications

### UX Requirements

- **Clear character/word limits**: Visible limits for description fields
- **Research-specific guidance**: Tailored information for scientific activities
- **Technical precision**: Accurate activity categories for research work
- **Validation feedback**: Confirmation that applications meet research needs

### Edge Cases

- **Ambiguous activity classification**: When research doesn't fit standard categories
- **Multi-methodology projects**: Research involving several different activities
- **Collaborative research**: Multi-institution and international collaborations
- **Long-term study permissions**: Research spanning multiple years or phases

## Persona Background

Dr. James represents the academic/research community that needs marine permissions for scientific work. His approach is methodical and documentation-focused, reflecting academic standards and research rigor.

He has technical competence with GIS and mapping tools but wants to ensure regulatory compliance rather than assume it. His research background makes him naturally thorough in reading guidance and seeking confirmation.

His perspective is valuable because research activities often push the boundaries of standard licensing categories, revealing gaps or ambiguities in the system.

## Research Quotes

- _"250 words or something like that. Is there a character or word limit. It's likely I would have a summary doc to copy from which would give context of the research, what you hope to find, justification"_
- _"This is a funny one, I will usually pick removal – its only semantics – we're pretty simple people in the ports"_
- _"As a person with research background I would spend more time reading the guidance to work out if I need a licence rather than just using the checker – would use to confirm"_
- _"Would do due diligence before answering. Boat traffic, speak to harbour commissioners"_

## Scientific Precision Needs

### Activity Classification

Dr. James struggles with activity categories that don't cleanly match research methodologies. His comment about "semantics" suggests the system's categories may not align well with how researchers think about their work.

### Documentation Standards

Research requires detailed documentation that goes beyond basic application requirements. He expects to provide methodology, justification, and research context that may exceed typical commercial application needs.

### Professional Due Diligence

His approach to "speaking to harbour commissioners" before answering questions shows the professional network consultation that's standard in research but may not be assumed by the system design.
