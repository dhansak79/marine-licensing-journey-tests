> _"I need to get through this quickly so I can get on with my job"_

## Role & Context

**Role**: Research Associate at a University  
**Primary Responsibility**: Conducting marine research requiring exemptions or licenses

### Daily Reality

Amy is a regular user of the marine licensing system who has submitted multiple applications. As a research professional, her workflow includes:

- Planning research projects that require marine access
- Obtaining necessary permissions before conducting field work
- Completing applications efficiently alongside other professional responsibilities
- Coordinating with colleagues who provide specialized information (e.g., location data)
- Managing multiple active applications simultaneously

### Key Challenges

- **Time Pressure**: Needs to complete administrative tasks quickly to focus on research
- **Ambiguous Guidance**: Sometimes struggles with unclear or ambiguous language
- **Collaboration Needs**: Often relies on colleagues for technical details like location information
- **Multiple Applications**: Has to manage several submissions in different states
- **Process Variations**: Must adapt to different requirements for different types of research

## Core Needs

1. **Efficiency and Speed**:

   - To complete applications quickly and with minimal friction
   - To reuse information from previous submissions where appropriate

2. **Professional Accuracy**:

   - To supply accurate project details to maintain professional credibility
   - To ensure compliance with regulations to avoid enforcement issues

3. **Collaborative Workflows**:

   - To easily incorporate information from colleagues
   - To share application status with research teams

4. **Clear Guidance**:
   - To understand specific requirements for different types of research
   - To navigate regulatory requirements confidently

## Testing Implications

### Critical Scenarios

- **Efficient repeat processes**: Streamlined workflows for returning users
- **Clear technical guidance**: Unambiguous instructions for complex inputs
- **Collaborative features**: Ability to incorporate colleague-provided information
- **Multi-application management**: Handling several submissions simultaneously

### UX Requirements

- **Recognition vs. Recall**: System remembers previous choices and patterns
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Efficient movement through forms
- **Smart Defaults**: Intelligent suggestions based on previous entries
- **Progress Indicators**: Clear view of completion status across applications
- **Status Tracking**: Easy monitoring of multiple submissions

### Edge Cases

- **Cross-application Consistency**: Maintaining data consistency across related applications
- **Specialized Research Types**: Handling unusual research activities
- **Professional Interruptions**: Recovering from workflow disruptions
- **Browser Tab Management**: Working across multiple applications in different tabs

## Persona Background

Amy has worked on marine research projects for several years and has become the go-to person in her department for navigating licensing requirements. She values efficiency and professional competence, wanting systems that respect her expertise while streamlining necessary administrative processes.

She's digitally confident and expects government services to work like other professional tools she uses. She has little patience for inefficient processes but will invest time in learning shortcuts that save her time in the long run.
