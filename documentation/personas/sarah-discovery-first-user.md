> _"I thought it was really easy... The coordinates threw me off a bit... I'd probably ring someone if got stuck."_

## Role & Context

**Role**: Property Owner / Individual with Marine Construction Needs  
**Organisation**: Individual applicant, occasional contact with marine licensing  
**Context**: First-time or infrequent interaction with marine licensing system

### Daily Reality

Sarah represents individuals who need marine permissions but don't work in the marine sector professionally. She might be a property owner wanting to install a pontoon, someone conducting occasional marine work, or a small business with infrequent marine licensing needs.

**Typical Scenarios:**

- Private pontoon installation
- Property-related marine construction
- Small-scale marine activities
- One-off marine permissions

### Key Challenges

- **Discovery Problems**: "Findability is the main challenge - all users struggled to find and interpret guidance content correctly"
- **Google-First Behavior**: "All started with a Google search, 2 users went to a local authority harbour website"
- **Digital Barriers**: "Needed help with the digital side... didn't like working on 2 screens"
- **Location Accuracy**: "I'd get an email. Because I've put those coords in wrong, I'd maybe expect there was a problem"

## Core Needs

1. **Discovery Support**:

   - Clear pathways from Google search to correct service
   - Distinction from local authority websites that appear in search
   - Understanding whether permission is needed at all

2. **Guidance Clarity**:

   - "Said she would need to read the guidance first to see if it was applicable"
   - Simple language that non-professionals can understand
   - Clear indication of what applies to their specific situation

3. **Digital Accessibility**:

   - Single-screen workflows where possible
   - Simple location input methods
   - Clear error prevention and recovery

4. **Confidence Building**:
   - Clear confirmation they can proceed
   - Understanding of what happens next
   - Backup support when stuck

## Behavioral Patterns

### Discovery Approach

- **Google-first**: Starts with web search rather than direct navigation
- **External site confusion**: May land on local authority sites instead of main service
- **Guidance dependency**: Wants to read supporting information before proceeding

### Interaction Style

- **Cautious progress**: "Unsure and asked for guidance from UR"
- **Error concern**: Worries about making mistakes with coordinates
- **Help-seeking**: "I'd probably ring someone" when encountering difficulties

### Technical Comfort

- **Basic digital skills**: Can complete online forms but has preferences (single screen)
- **Location challenges**: "Struggled a bit with finding the location on the map... Drew a triangle. Guessed with it"
- **Screenshot habits**: "I would take a screenshot of this probably"

## Testing Implications

### Critical Scenarios

- **Initial discovery journeys**: How users find the service through search engines
- **Guidance interpretation workflows**: Reading and understanding whether service applies
- **Location input alternatives**: Map drawing, postcode entry, coordinate assistance
- **Error recovery paths**: What happens when users make mistakes

### UX Requirements

- **Search engine optimisation**: Ensuring correct service appears in search results
- **Clear service boundaries**: Distinguishing from local authority services
- **Progressive disclosure**: Not overwhelming users with information
- **Error prevention**: Clear guidance to avoid common mistakes

### Edge Cases

- **Wrong website navigation**: Users landing on incorrect local authority sites
- **Incomplete applications**: Users starting but not completing due to confusion
- **Support escalation**: When users need human help
- **Multi-device usage**: Coordination across devices and screens

## Persona Background

Sarah represents the "occasional user" who doesn't have professional familiarity with marine licensing. Her interaction with the system is likely driven by a specific need rather than ongoing work requirements.

Her Google-first approach reflects typical consumer behaviour online, but creates challenges when government services aren't optimised for this discovery pattern. She's digitally capable but has clear preferences for simplicity.

Her cautious approach shows she wants to "do things right" but lacks confidence in her understanding of requirements and processes.

## Research Quotes

- _"All users struggled to find and interpret guidance content correctly. All started with a Google search"_
- _"Said she would need to read the guidance first to see if it was applicable to her"_
- _"Struggled a bit with finding the location on the map... Drew a triangle. Guessed with it"_
- _"I thought it was really easy... The coordinates threw me off a bit... I'd probably ring someone if got stuck"_

## Discovery Journey Insights

### Search Behaviour

The research shows all users start with Google search rather than navigating directly to government websites. This creates a significant findability challenge that isn't addressed by optimising the service itself.

### Guidance Expectations

Sarah's approach of reading guidance first suggests she doesn't trust her initial understanding of requirements. This careful approach is positive but suggests the main user journey may not provide sufficient confidence.

### Digital Preferences

Her discomfort with multi-screen work and preference for simple interfaces suggests the service needs to accommodate varying levels of digital confidence while maintaining functionality.

### Error Anxiety

Concerns about coordinate accuracy show she's aware of the importance of getting things right but lacks confidence in her ability to provide technical information accurately.
