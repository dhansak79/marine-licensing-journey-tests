> _"One of the pain points is repeating info. Very glad to see this."_

## Role & Context

**Role**: Marine Licensing Consultant & Project Coordinator  
**Organisation**: Independent consultant working with tidal defence organisations, coastal partnerships  
**Scope**: Applies on behalf of multiple clients, coordinates complex multi-site projects

### Daily Reality

Elena specialises in navigating the marine licensing system for organisations that don't have internal expertise. She manages "longstanding complex projects which may involve multiple exemptions as well as licence applications" and needs to coordinate across organisational boundaries.

**Typical Work:**

- Tidal defence infrastructure projects
- Multi-site exemption notifications
- Coastal partnership coordination
- Cross-boundary organisational projects

### Key Challenges

- **Information Repetition**: "One of the pain points is repeating info" across multiple related applications
- **Project Fragmentation**: Need to "retrospectively link as the project grows"
- **Account Management**: "Why do you need a defra account if you don't have an MMO one?"
- **Organisational Views**: "Need an organisational basket view as well as a personal basket"

## Core Needs

1. **Project Linking**:

   - Connect multiple exemptions and applications under one umbrella project
   - Retrospectively group applications as projects evolve
   - Track dependencies between related submissions

2. **Collaboration Infrastructure**:

   - "Often a large project will have multiple exemptions and applications they need to see linked together"
   - Organsational dashboard for team oversight
   - Client access and review capabilities

3. **Efficiency Tools**:

   - Minimise duplicate data entry across related applications
   - Template and copying functionality for similar projects
   - Bulk operations for multi-site submissions

4. **Account Management**:
   - Clear separation between personal and organisational work
   - Client representation permissions
   - System access coordination

## Behavioural Patterns

### Project Organisation

- **Growth mindset**: Projects "grow" and need retrospective organsation
- **Relationship mapping**: Sees connections between applications that system doesn't recognise
- **Client coordination**: Manages multiple organisational relationships simultaneously

### Efficiency Seeking

- **Pattern recognition**: "Very glad to see this" when system recognises common needs
- **Template usage**: Likely to create reusable approaches for similar projects
- **Bulk processing**: Manages multiple sites within single projects

### Collaboration Focus

- **Organisational awareness**: Understands team vs. individual needs
- **Access control**: Manages who can see and edit different parts of projects
- **Communication facilitation**: Bridges between technical teams and regulatory requirements

## Testing Implications

### Critical Scenarios

- **Multi-site project workflows**: Single project with different dates/descriptions per site
- **Project linking interfaces**: How to connect related applications
- **Organisational permissions**: Who can access what on behalf of whom
- **Template and copying flows**: Reusing information across similar projects

### UX Requirements

- **Project relationship visualisation**: Clear understanding of connected applications
- **Organisational dashboards**: Team-level view of all projects
- **Permission management**: Fine-grained access control for clients
- **Bulk editing capabilities**: Efficient multi-site data entry

### Edge Cases

- **Retrospective linking**: Adding connections to existing applications
- **Cross-organisational projects**: Multiple clients on single project
- **Account switching**: Moving between personal and client work
- **Project evolution**: When scope changes significantly during process

## Persona Background

Elena developed her expertise through working with organisations that occasionally need marine licensing but don't have dedicated staff. Her consultant perspective gives her broad visibility into how different organisations approach these processes, making her particularly valuable for system design insights.

She's highly focused on efficiency and reducing administrative burden, both for herself and her clients. Her work often involves educating clients about requirements while handling the technical aspects of submissions.

Her coordination role means she sees patterns across projects and organisations that individual applicants might miss, making her feedback particularly valuable for system improvements.

## Research Quotes

- _"Longstanding complex projects which may involve multiple exemptions as well as licence application. It would be useful for them to view these as one project"_
- _"They will want to retrospectively link as the project grows"_
- _"Often a large project will have multiple exemptions and applications they need to see linked together"_
- _"Organisational users often collaborate on projects and need an organisational basket view as well as a personal basket"_

## Pain Points in Detail

### Information Duplication

When managing multiple sites or related applications, Elena frequently encounters requests for the same information repeatedly. The research shows she's "very glad" when systems recognise this pattern and offer solutions.

### Project Growth Complexity

Projects often start small and expand, requiring Elena to manage connections between applications that weren't initially related. The need for "retrospective linking" suggests current systems don't handle project evolution well.

### Multi-Organisation Coordination

Elena works across organisational boundaries, requiring careful management of permissions, access, and responsibilities across different teams and clients.
