# Simon - Marine Officer

![Marine Officer](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=Simon+-+Marine+Officer)

> _"My main focus is gathering evidence and investigating non-compliance"_

## Role & Context

**Role**: Marine enforcement officer  
**Primary Responsibility**: Monitoring compliance and enforcing marine regulations  
**Status**: _Awaiting further validation_

### Daily Reality

Simon spends much of his time in the field, patrolling marine areas to ensure activities comply with regulations. His typical workflow involves:

- Patrolling designated marine areas to inspect activities
- Gathering evidence at sites where activities are taking place
- Returning to the office to check what permissions are in place
- Investigating potential non-compliance cases
- Determining if enforcement action is necessary

### Key Challenges

- **Disconnected Workflows**: Cannot check permissions while in the field
- **System Usability**: Finds the legacy system difficult to use for reviewing submissions
- **Data Management**: Prefers spreadsheets for data interrogation and updates
- **Information Access**: Struggles to quickly find exemption details for specific areas
- **Risk Assessment**: Needs to prioritize high-risk activities efficiently

## Core Needs

1. **Evidence Gathering**:

   - To collect and document site observations effectively
   - To verify these against existing permissions

2. **Geographic Information Access**:

   - To know what exemptions exist in specific areas
   - To assess spatial compliance of activities

3. **Risk Prioritization**:
   - To identify high-risk activities requiring attention
   - To efficiently manage workload based on compliance risk
4. **Data Portability**:
   - To access and update information in preferred formats (e.g., spreadsheets)
   - To maintain inspection records alongside permission details

## Testing Implications

### Critical Scenarios

- **Mobile/field access**: Information retrieval in non-office settings
- **Data export capabilities**: Exporting to spreadsheets and other formats
- **Geographic searching**: Area-based filtering and visualization
- **Risk assessment features**: Prioritization tools and risk indicators
- **Field-to-office transitions**: Workflow continuity between locations

### UX Requirements

- **Quick Search**: Fast retrieval of relevant permissions by location
- **Offline Capabilities**: Access to critical information without connectivity
- **Efficient Updates**: Easy recording of inspection outcomes
- **Spatial Visualization**: Map-based views of activities and permissions
- **Data Manipulation**: Sorting, filtering, and analyzing compliance data

### Edge Cases

- **Remote Access**: Areas with limited connectivity
- **Complex Spatial Queries**: Overlapping permissions and activities
- **Historical Comparisons**: Tracking compliance patterns over time
- **Risk Algorithm Edge Cases**: Unusual activities that don't fit standard risk profiles

## Persona Background

Simon has been an enforcement officer for several years. He's passionate about marine protection but frustrated by systems that slow down his work. He's developed his own workarounds, primarily using spreadsheets to track and manage the information he needs.

He's comfortable with technology when it works efficiently but has little patience for cumbersome interfaces that waste his time in the field. He values tools that help him make better enforcement decisions with less administrative overhead.

## Test Charter Connections

This persona should inform the development of enforcement-focused test charters that validate:

- Mobile access capabilities
- Data export and import features
- Geographical search functionality
- Risk assessment and prioritization tools

_This persona is based on initial user research with Marine Management Organisation enforcement staff. The details are awaiting further validation to ensure they accurately represent user needs and challenges._
