## Role & Context

**Role**: Marine Licensing Case Officer & Business Support  
**Organisation**: MMO Central Processing Team  
**Focus**: Application review, exemption processing, enquiry support

### Daily Reality

David works in the central marine licensing team, reviewing applications and exemption notifications before they go to regional teams. He handles the initial processing and quality checking that determines how cases flow through the system.

**Key Activities:**

- Initial application and exemption review
- Enquiry handling and customer support
- Data entry and system management
- Escalation to Principal Officers and Marine Officers

### Key Challenges

- **Manual Data Duplication**: "Very manual process... significant time spent on repetitive data entry"
- **System Disconnection**: "Navigating between disconnected systems"
- **Regional Assignment Errors**: "Sometimes goes to wrong region, human error"
- **Uncertain Escalation**: "Check with Principal Officer if uncertain, flag unusual ones to Marine Officers"

## Core Needs

1. **Streamlined Processing**:

   - Automated data transfer between systems
   - Reduced duplicate entry requirements
   - Clear processing workflows

2. **Decision Support**:

   - Clear escalation criteria
   - Guidance for unusual cases
   - Quick access to Principal Officer consultation

3. **System Integration**:

   - Connected systems that share data
   - Single view of case information
   - Reduced system switching

4. **Customer Support Tools**:
   - Quick access to application information for enquiries
   - Standard responses for common questions
   - Efficient communication channels

## Behavioral Patterns

### Processing Approach

- **Quality checking**: "Reviews exemption notifications" before regional assignment
- **Escalation protocols**: Clear hierarchy for uncertain cases
- **Regional awareness**: "Sometimes goes to wrong region" suggests geographic knowledge requirements

### Administrative Efficiency

- **Routine processing**: "Usually there is no action to take" for most exemptions
- **Exception handling**: Identifies unusual cases that need specialist attention
- **Training maintenance**: "Attend monthly training sessions to stay updated"

### Support Orientation

- **Customer focus**: Handling enquiries from applicants
- **Information access**: Needs quick retrieval of case details
- **Problem solving**: Bridges between applicants and technical specialists

## Testing Implications

### Critical Scenarios

- **Rapid case review workflows**: Efficient processing of standard applications
- **Escalation decision interfaces**: Clear criteria and pathways for unusual cases
- **Customer enquiry support**: Quick access to case information
- **Regional assignment accuracy**: Correct geographic routing

### UX Requirements

- **Integrated dashboards**: Single view of case information across systems
- **Decision trees**: Clear guidance for escalation decisions
- **Quick search capabilities**: Rapid case lookup for enquiry support
- **Automated routing**: Geographic assignment with error prevention

### Edge Cases

- **Unusual case identification**: What makes a case require escalation
- **Cross-system data inconsistencies**: When information doesn't match between platforms
- **High-volume processing periods**: Efficiency during peak application times
- **Complex enquiry resolution**: Multi-step customer support scenarios

## Persona Background

David represents the central processing function that creates the foundation for all marine licensing workflows. His work determines case quality and routing accuracy, affecting everyone downstream in the process.

His administrative perspective provides insights into system efficiency and data quality issues that may not be visible to field staff or applicants. His customer support role gives him direct feedback on user pain points and confusion areas.

The tension between processing efficiency and quality checking creates time pressures that drive his need for better tools and automation.

- _"They will flag unusual ones to the Marine Officers"_
- _"Very manual process... significant time spent on repetitive data entry"_
- _"Sometimes goes to wrong region, human error"_

## System Integration Needs

### Data Flow Efficiency

David's work involves significant manual data entry and system switching. Research indicates this creates both efficiency problems and error opportunities that affect the entire licensing process.

### Decision Support Requirements

The need to "check with Principal Officer if uncertain" suggests current systems don't provide sufficient guidance for edge cases, requiring human consultation that could be reduced with better decision support tools.

### Quality Assurance Role

David's position as a quality checker before regional assignment means his efficiency and accuracy directly impacts downstream workload and case routing effectiveness.

### Customer Interface Impact

His enquiry handling role means system inefficiencies and information access problems directly affect customer experience and satisfaction with the licensing service.
