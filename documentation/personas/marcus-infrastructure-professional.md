# Marcus - Infrastructure Professional

![Infrastructure Professional](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=Marcus+-+Infrastructure+Professional)

> _"Best thing MMO ever did was introduce the self service tool. I use it pretty regularly."_

## Role & Context

**Role**: Environment Specialist at Major Port Authority  
**Organisation**: Port of Southampton (one of UK's largest ports)  
**Team Context**: Part of 6-person major projects team, works across 20+ ports in organisation

### Daily Reality

Marcus has worked in the marine sector for 27+ years and handles "anything remotely connected with development or licensing." He's the principal contact for his port and puts in 4-5 applications per year, ranging from small projects to major infrastructure like 1 million cubic meter dredges.

**Typical Projects:**

- Port infrastructure development
- Dredging operations (routine and major)
- Bore hole licensing
- Sister company support for smaller ports

### Key Challenges

- **GIS Dependency**: "I am not a GIS person... I would lean on ABP Mayor to provide files to upload, not an expert in the locations"
- **System Migration Anxiety**: "Will my information be migrated from MCMS? It's quite confusing, two systems"
- **Technical Coordination**: "I am the in-between person... Their expert would pass locations to GIS person"
- **Historical Data Access**: "I'd be interested to know if I will still be able to search through my old applications"

## Core Needs

1. **Data Continuity**:

   - Access to historical applications across system changes
   - Ability to search through previous submissions for reference

2. **Technical Coordination**:

   - Seamless handoff between GIS specialists and application submission
   - Support for shapefile uploads from technical experts

3. **Project Allocation Efficiency**:

   - Clear project ownership within team
   - "Everyone does everything, a person will be allocated to a project and they do that project"

4. **Validation Tools**:
   - "For smaller projects I like to use the checker as a validation for our own checking"

## Behavioral Patterns

### Preparation Approach

- **File-first workflow**: "Ideally would have everything ready"
- **Risk aversion**: "I wouldn't be comfortable plotting out the shape on a map, I'd rather get someone else to do it"
- **Validation seeking**: Uses checker to confirm rather than discover requirements

### Technical Interaction

- **Sense-checking**: "I'd give it a sense-check to see if it ties in with landmarks"
- **Tool preferences**: "I might try and plot it on arcGIS if needed"
- **Format awareness**: Prefers shapefiles, understands coordinate limitations

### Team Dynamics

- **Sister company support**: Sometimes works with smaller ports on applications
- **Knowledge sharing**: "Principal contact" role suggests expertise distribution
- **Experience leverage**: Uses 27+ years of sector knowledge for problem-solving

## Testing Implications

### Critical Scenarios

- **System migration workflows**: How historical data transfers and remains accessible
- **Multi-organisation support**: Supporting sister companies and smaller ports
- **Technical handoff processes**: GIS specialist to application submission
- **Large-scale project management**: Million cubic meter dredge applications

### UX Requirements

- **Historical search capabilities**: Easy access to previous applications
- **File upload optimsation**: Streamlined shapefile handling
- **Multi-project dashboards**: Overview of organisation-wide submissions
- **Validation feedback**: Clear confirmation of requirement checking

### Edge Cases

- **Cross-organisation permissions**: Who can submit on behalf of whom
- **Large file handling**: Complex shapes with 50+ coordinate points
- **System transition periods**: Dual system running scenarios
- **Regional assignment errors**: When applications go to wrong regions

## Persona Background

Marcus represents the experienced infrastructure professional who has seen the marine licensing system evolve over decades. He values efficiency and reliability, having developed workflows that leverage team expertise effectively. His cautious approach to technical tasks reflects the high-stakes nature of major port infrastructure projects.

He's digitally confident within his area of expertise but recognises the limits of his technical knowledge, particularly around GIS and location data. His preference for validation tools shows a professional approach to regulatory compliance.
