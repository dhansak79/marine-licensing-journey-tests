# User Personas

This directory contains user personas based on comprehensive user research conducted with real marine licensing system users. These personas represent actual user behaviors, needs, and pain points discovered through direct research rather than assumptions.

## ðŸ”¬ Research-Based Approach

All personas in this collection are derived from:

- Direct user interviews and testing sessions
- Observational research with MMO staff
- Live service testing with real applicants
- Organisational visits and workflow analysis
- Marine Licensing Champion feedback
- Beta service research and feedback

Each persona includes direct quotes from research participants and specific behavioral patterns observed during research sessions.

## ðŸŽ¯ How to Use These Personas

### For Testing

Each persona includes specific "Testing Implications" sections with:

- Critical scenarios to validate
- UX requirements to meet
- Edge cases to consider

### For Design Decisions

Use personas to:

- Validate feature priorities against real user needs
- Check if proposed solutions address actual pain points
- Ensure designs work for the full spectrum of users

### For Product Planning

Consider how features serve:

- Different experience levels (Marcus vs. Sarah)
- Various organisational contexts (individual vs. consultant vs. port authority)
- Multiple use cases (one-off vs. ongoing vs. complex projects)

## ðŸ“Š Research Evidence

Each persona file includes:

- **Direct quotes** from research participants
- **Behavioral patterns** observed during testing
- **Pain points** identified through research
- **Testing implications** based on actual user needs

## ðŸ”„ Persona Maintenance

These personas should be updated as new research becomes available. The research-based approach means they reflect real user needs rather than assumptions, making them more reliable for design and testing decisions.

When conducting new research:

1. Compare findings against existing personas
2. Update personas with new insights and quotes
3. Add new personas if distinct user types are discovered
4. Remove or merge personas if research shows overlap

---

_These personas replace previous assumption-based personas and represent a shift toward evidence-based user understanding. All quotes and behaviors are derived from actual research sessions with real marine licensing system users._
