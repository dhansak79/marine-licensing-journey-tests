> _"It's difficult to get my head around whether I need a licence"_

## Role & context

**Role**: Property owner  
**Primary responsibility**: Completing a construction project that requires marine licensing consideration

### Daily reality

Zofia is completely new to marine licensing and has no prior experience with the regulatory process. Her situation involves:

- Planning a construction project that affects a marine area (typically property repairs or development)
- Trying to understand complex regulatory requirements with no previous knowledge
- Learning unfamiliar terminology and processes as she goes
- Navigating technical requirements like coordinate entry with no prior experience
- Managing project timelines alongside regulatory compliance

### Key challenges

- **Knowledge gap**: Unfamiliar with marine licensing terminology and processes
- **Uncertainty**: Unclear whether her project needs a licence or exemption
- **Technical barriers**: Struggles with providing accurate location details
- **Time pressure**: Needs to understand how long the process takes to plan her project
- **Guidance complexity**: Finds existing documentation overwhelming and full of unfamiliar terms
- **Digital confidence**: May have varying levels of digital skills and confidence

## Core needs

1. **Clear decision guidance**:

   - To understand if she needs a licence or exemption
   - To confidently determine regulatory requirements

2. **Plain language assistance**:

   - To navigate unfamiliar terminology
   - To understand technical requirements in accessible terms

3. **Timeline transparency**:

   - To know how long the process will take
   - To plan her project around regulatory timelines

4. **Technical support**:

   - To provide accurate location details despite unfamiliarity with coordinates
   - To complete all requirements correctly to avoid enforcement issues

5. **Reassurance**:
   - To feel confident she's following the correct process
   - To understand the consequences of her choices

## Testing implications

### Critical scenarios

- **First-time user journey**: Complete application flow for newcomers
- **Decision support tools**: Licence vs. exemption guidance
- **Plain English content**: Terminology explanation and simplification
- **Location data assistance**: Alternative methods for coordinate entry
- **Process transparency**: Clear timelines and next steps
- **Digital inclusion**: Support for users with varying digital skills

### UX requirements

- **Progressive disclosure**: Information presented in manageable chunks
- **Context-sensitive help**: Guidance available exactly when needed
- **Error prevention**: Proactive help before mistakes happen
- **Plain language**: Technical terms explained in everyday language
- **Visual aids**: Maps and visual tools for location specification
- **Progress tracking**: Clear indication of completion status

### Edge cases

- **Digital exclusion**: Alternative pathways for users with limited digital access
- **Terminology confusion**: Recovery from misunderstandings of technical terms
- **Assisted digital**: Support pathways for users who need help
- **Partial completion**: Saving progress and returning later
- **Decision reconsideration**: Changing from exemption to licence path mid-process

## Persona background

Zofia has no previous experience with marine licensing or similar regulatory processes. Her property renovation project has unexpectedly brought her into contact with marine regulations, and she's determined to do things properly while minimising delays to her project.

She's reasonably comfortable with everyday technology but becomes anxious when faced with unfamiliar technical requirements or specialised terminology. She values clear explanations and reassurance that she's following the correct process.
