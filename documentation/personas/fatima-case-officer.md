> _"It's a very manual process"_

## Role & Context

**Role**: Marine Management Organisation business support team  
**Primary Responsibility**: Processing marine licensing applications and exemptions

### Daily Reality

Fatima is an expert user of the legacy system with extensive knowledge of marine licensing processes. Her days are filled with:

- Supporting colleagues with system knowledge

### Key Challenges

- **Manual Processes**: Significant time spent on repetitive data entry

   - To see exemption details to support enquiries
   - To access information quickly when applicants call

2. **Efficient Process Management**:
   - To minimize duplicate data entry
   - To streamline manual workflows
3. **Effective Support Tools**:
   - To help users, especially with complex inputs like location details
   - To provide accurate guidance on process requirements

## Testing Implications

### Critical Scenarios

### UX Requirements

### Edge Cases
