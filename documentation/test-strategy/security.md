### **Testing Constraints & Considerations**

#### **Platform Security Context**

**DEFRA Core Delivery Platform (CDP)**:

- **AWS cloud-hosted platform** - Eliminates need for teams to build or understand underlying AWS infrastructure
- **Governance and security by design** - Platform strengthens overall governance and security requirements through common patterns
- **Infrastructure security validated** - CDP platform has undergone independent security assessment and penetration testing
- **Built-in security features** - Includes secure file upload and virus scanning service, authentication test harnesses
- **Government compliance** - Designed to meet government cloud security standards and development standards

**CDP Platform Capabilities**:

- **CI/CD pipeline security** - Fundamental services for logs, metrics, test suites with self-service deployments
- **Self-healing capabilities** - Automated rollback and recovery features reduce security incident impact
- **Common security patterns** - Standardised approach ensures consistent security implementation across services
- **Test infrastructure** - Built-in tools and patterns for various types of testing in local and deployed environments

**Implications for Penetration Testing**:

- **Reduced infrastructure scope** - Platform-level security already validated and maintained

## üéØ Security Requirements

Key security expectations for marine licensing:

### **Data Protection**

- **Personal data handling** in line with GDPR and government data standards
- **Application data security** protecting sensitive marine licensing information
- **File upload security** for supporting documentation and evidence
- **Session management** and secure authentication

### **Access Control**

- **Role-based access** for MMO staff and external applicants
- **Authentication security** and password policies
- **Authorisation testing** ensuring users can only access appropriate data
- **Administrative access** protection and audit trails

## üöÄ Implementation Approach

Security should be supported through:

- **Secure test data practices** avoiding real personal or sensitive data
- **Environment isolation** ensuring test data doesn't compromise production
- **Access control testing** validating user permissions and data access
- **Input validation testing** through comprehensive form testing

## üéØ Testing Approach

Planned security testing includes:

- **Authentication and session testing** for user access security
- **Input validation and sanitisation** testing to prevent injection attacks
- **File upload security** testing for malicious content protection
- **Cross-site scripting (XSS)** and cross-site request forgery (CSRF) testing
- **Data exposure testing** ensuring sensitive information isn't leaked

## üìä Security Metrics

Key security indicators:

- **Vulnerability detection rate** and resolution time
- **Security test coverage** across critical user journeys
- **Authentication failure handling** and security incident response
- **Data protection compliance** and audit trail completeness

## üéØ Government Security Standards

Security aligned with:

- **Government security classifications** and data handling requirements
- **GDPR compliance** for personal data protection
- **Cabinet Office security standards** for government digital services
- **Cyber security best practices** for public sector applications

## üîê Security-by-Design

Integration with development practices:

- **Threat modelling** during feature design and implementation
- **Security automation** in CI/CD pipelines
- **Security code review** and static analysis
- **Continuous security monitoring** and incident response

### **Open Source Security Considerations**

**Public Code Repository Context**:

- **Full source code transparency** - Marine licensing application code is fully open source and publicly available
- **No security through obscurity** - Security must rely on robust implementation rather than hidden code
- **Enhanced attack surface analysis** - Potential attackers can perform detailed code review to identify vulnerabilities
- **Public vulnerability disclosure** - Security issues may be discoverable through public code inspection

**Open Source Security Implications**:

**Increased Security Requirements**:

- **Code quality standards** - Higher security coding standards required due to public visibility
- **Secrets management** - Critical importance of keeping credentials, API keys, and sensitive configuration out of repositories
- **Dependency security** - Public visibility of all third-party dependencies and versions
- **Configuration security** - Deployment and environment-specific configuration must be secured separately

**Penetration Testing Considerations**:

- **Source code analysis** - Penetration testers can perform white-box testing with full code access
- **Dependency vulnerability analysis** - Review of all open source dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- **Configuration review** - Analysis of how application is configured and deployed securely
- **Business logic vulnerability discovery** - Detailed code review may reveal logic flaws not apparent from black-box testing

**Open Source Security Benefits**:

- **Community security review** - "Many eyes make all bugs shallow" principle applies to security vulnerabilities
- **Transparent security practices** - Security implementations can be reviewed and validated by security community
- **Rapid vulnerability patching** - Public disclosure encourages prompt security updates
- **Security best practice demonstration** - Implementation serves as example for other government open source projects

**Mitigation Strategies**:

- **Secure development practices** - Security coding standards, peer review, automated security scanning (SonarQube)
- **Secrets management** - Environment variables, secure configuration management, no hard-coded credentials
- **Automated dependency monitoring** - Dependabot integration in both `marine-licensing-frontend` and `marine-licensing-backend` repositories automatically tracks dependency updates and raises pull requests for security patches
- **Dependency vulnerability scanning** - Regular automated scanning for known vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies
- **Security-first design** - Assumption that all code is visible to potential attackers
