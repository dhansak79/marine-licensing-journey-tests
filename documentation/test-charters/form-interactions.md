# Form Interactions Charter: Input Validation & Behaviour

## Investigation Plan

**EXPLORE:** Form behaviour, validation patterns, and interaction design across all delivered features  
**AS:** All user types interacting with forms (see References)  
**BECAUSE:** Form interactions are critical touchpoints that determine user success or abandonment  
**LOOKING FOR:** Validation issues, interaction problems, error handling gaps, usability friction across the complete workflow

**Duration:** 80 minutes  
**Priority:** High

## Scenario Context

**Research Insights on Form Interaction:**

**Sarah (Discovery-First)**: _"The coordinates threw me off a bit"_ - Form complexity can create user anxiety
**Dr. James (Research)**: _"250 words or something like that. Is there a character or word limit?"_ - Professional users need clear field constraints
**Elena (Multi-Project)**: _"One of the pain points is repeating info"_ - Form efficiency expectations
**Marcus (Infrastructure)**: _"I'd give it a sense-check to see if it ties in with landmarks"_ - Professional validation patterns

**Focus**: How users interact with forms, validation, and error handling across the complete exemption notification workflow.

## Realistic Activities

- Test input validation and error handling across all major forms in sequence
- Investigate enhanced activity dates validation (specific day/month/year error messages)
- Test coordinate entry validation for both WGS84 and OSGB36 systems with edge cases
- Assess character limits and guidance clarity for activity description
- Test radio button behaviour and conditional logic in public register and site details forms
- Evaluate cross-form navigation, interruptions, and state preservation
- Test error recovery patterns and validation message clarity
- Simulate edge cases: special characters, copy/paste, very long text, boundary values
- Test with different browsers, devices, and assistive technologies
- Investigate form completion patterns under time pressure

## Evidence Framework

### ‚úÖ Positive signals

- **Validation clarity**: Error messages guide users toward successful completion
- **Interaction fluency**: Forms respond predictably to user input patterns
- **Accessibility support**: Forms work effectively with assistive technology
- **State preservation**: User data persists appropriately across navigation
- **Error prevention**: Interface prevents common user mistakes before submission

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning signs

- **Validation confusion**: Error messages confuse rather than help recovery
- **Interaction friction**: Unexpected form behaviour or delayed responses
- **Accessibility barriers**: Screen reader or keyboard navigation problems
- **Data loss risk**: Form state not preserved during navigation or interruptions
- **Error cascade**: Single mistakes trigger multiple confusing error messages

### ü§î Questions to investigate

- How do the enhanced date validation patterns (specific day/month/year errors) affect user recovery?
- What happens when users interact with coordinate entry forms in unexpected ways?
- How consistent are validation patterns across different form types in the workflow?
- Are there differences in form behaviour that create confusion between sections?
- How well do forms work with copy/paste of professional data?

### üí° Ideas to explore

- Could validation feedback be more helpful or timely across the workflow?
- Are there opportunities to prevent common coordinate entry errors?
- How might character limit guidance be improved for professional documentation needs?
- What form interaction patterns could improve efficiency for repeat users?
