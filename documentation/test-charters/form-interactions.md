# Form Interactions Charter: Input Validation & Behaviour

## Investigation Plan

**EXPLORE:** Form behaviour, validation patterns, and interaction design across delivered features  
**AS:** All user types interacting with forms (see References)  
**BECAUSE:** Form interactions are critical touchpoints that can make or break user experience  
**LOOKING FOR:** Validation issues, interaction problems, error handling gaps, usability friction

**Duration:** 80 minutes  
**Priority:** High

## Scenario Context

- Focus: How users interact with forms, validation, and error handling across the application.
- For detailed requirements and persona context, see References above.

## Realistic Activities

- Test input validation, error handling, and recovery for all major forms.
- Assess conditional logic, state management, and accessibility.
- Simulate cross-form navigation, interruptions, and edge cases.
- Test with different browsers, devices, and assistive technologies.

## Evidence Framework

### ‚úÖ Positive signals

- Validation clarity, interaction fluency, accessibility support, state preservation, conditional logic clarity.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning signs

- Validation confusion, interaction friction, accessibility barriers, data loss risk, conditional logic problems.

### ü§î Questions to investigate

- How do validation patterns compare across different forms?
- What happens when users interact with forms in unexpected ways?
- How well do forms work with assistive technology and different input methods?
- Are there consistency issues in form behaviour across the application?

### üí° Ideas to explore

- Could validation feedback be more helpful or timely?
- Are there opportunities to prevent common user errors?
- How might conditional logic be made clearer or more intuitive?
- What form interaction patterns could improve efficiency?
