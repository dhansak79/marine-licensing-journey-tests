# Site Details Charter: Location Method & Coordinate System Selection

## Investigation Plan

**EXPLORE:** Site location selection options and coordinate system choices  
**AS:** Marine licensing applicants (see References)  
**BECAUSE:** Spatial data selection is critical to application accuracy  
**LOOKING FOR:** Usability issues in selection screens, navigation problems, validation clarity

**Duration:** 85 minutes  
**Priority:** High

## Scenario Context

**Beta Research Insights**:

- _"Even organisational pro users find providing location details the most challenging"_
- _"Some pro users would like to draw on a map and most users we spoke to ask a GIS specialist to prepare their shapefile"_
- _"I can do it if it's lat/long or x/y, otherwise I'd have to look it up. In portal you get various options, it's confusing"_
- _"They wouldn't typically enter the system without this information ready"_

**Critical Finding**: Location details are universally challenging across all user types, with significant reliance on external specialists.

## Realistic Activities

- Test decision-making between file upload and manual coordinate entry based on delivered functionality
- Investigate understanding of circle vs coordinate list options (delivered choice points)
- Test coordinate system selection confidence (WGS84 vs OSGB36) across different user technical backgrounds
- Evaluate help text effectiveness for coordinate system guidance
- Test navigation flow through the delivered site details selection screens
- Simulate scenarios where users have existing coordinate data but are unsure how to proceed

## Evidence Framework

### ‚úÖ Positive signals

- Conceptual clarity, selection confidence, navigation fluency, validation helpfulness, selection persistence.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning signs

- Terminology confusion, selection uncertainty, navigation disorientation, validation frustration, session issues.

### ü§î Questions to investigate

- How do users with different geospatial knowledge approach the screens?
- What mental models do users have about site boundaries and locations?
- How do users decide between circle and polygon?
- What factors influence coordinate system selection?

### üí° Ideas to explore

- Could selection guidance be improved for non-technical users?
- Are there opportunities for smarter defaults?
- How might the interface better support coordinate system selection?
- What additional context would help users make informed selections?
