# Site Details Charter: Complete Coordinate Entry Workflow

## Investigation Plan

**EXPLORE:** Complete site details coordinate entry workflow including system selection and validation  
**AS:** Marine licensing applicants (see References)  
**BECAUSE:** Coordinate entry is universally challenging and critical to application accuracy  
**LOOKING FOR:** Usability issues in coordinate workflows, validation clarity, decision confidence, error recovery patterns  
**NOTE:** Some advanced back/cancel navigation scenarios from coordinate entry pages are marked @wip (ML-35, ML-36)

**Duration:** 100 minutes  
**Priority:** High

## Scenario Context

**Research Insights on Coordinate Entry:**

**Sarah (Discovery-First)**: _"The coordinates threw me off a bit"_ and _"Struggled a bit with finding the location on the map... Drew a triangle. Guessed with it"_ - Coordinate concepts create anxiety for non-technical users

**Marcus (Infrastructure)**: _"I am not a GIS person... I would lean on ABP Mayor to provide files to upload, not an expert in the locations"_ - Professional reliance on specialists

**Dr. James (Research)**: _"I've worked with ArcGIS which would give you points"_ - Technical competence but seeks validation

**Elena (Multi-Project)**: Professional coordinator patterns working with client-provided location data

**Critical Research Finding**: _"Even organisational pro users find providing location details the most challenging"_ - Universal difficulty across all user types.

## Realistic Activities

- Test complete coordinate entry workflow: manual selection ‚Üí circle choice ‚Üí coordinate system selection ‚Üí centre point entry ‚Üí width entry ‚Üí review
- Investigate coordinate system selection confidence (WGS84 vs OSGB36) across different user technical backgrounds
- Test centre point coordinate entry accuracy for both systems with realistic scenarios
- Evaluate decimal place precision understanding (6 decimal places for WGS84)
- Test coordinate range validation (latitude -90 to 90, longitude -180 to 180, positive values for OSGB36)
- Investigate width entry validation and units comprehension
- Test review screen comprehension and completion confidence
- Evaluate error recovery patterns for coordinate validation failures
- Test navigation flow and state preservation through the complete workflow
- Simulate scenarios where users have existing coordinate data but are uncertain about system choice
- Test help text effectiveness for coordinate system guidance
- Investigate professional workflows with prepared coordinate data

## Evidence Framework

### ‚úÖ Positive signals

- **Decision confidence**: Clear understanding of coordinate system choices and consequences
- **Entry accuracy**: Users can successfully enter valid coordinates for their sites
- **Validation support**: Error messages help users correct coordinate problems
- **Workflow completion**: Users successfully progress through entire coordinate entry sequence
- **Professional integration**: Workflow accommodates existing professional coordinate data

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning signs

- **System confusion**: Uncertainty about WGS84 vs OSGB36 choice or consequences
- **Entry errors**: Frequent coordinate validation failures or format confusion
- **Validation frustration**: Error messages don't help users understand or fix problems
- **Workflow abandonment**: Users get stuck or confused in coordinate entry sequence
- **Professional friction**: Interface doesn't accommodate professional data workflows

### ü§î Questions to investigate

- How do users with different geospatial knowledge approach coordinate system selection?
- What strategies do users employ when coordinate entry validation fails?
- How do users understand decimal place precision requirements for different coordinate systems?
- What happens when users try to enter coordinates outside valid ranges?
- How effectively does the review screen build confidence in coordinate accuracy?

### üí° Ideas to explore

- Could coordinate system selection guidance be more accessible to non-technical users?
- Are there opportunities to better validate coordinate accuracy during entry?
- How might width entry be made clearer for users unfamiliar with measurement concepts?
- What additional context would help users verify their coordinate entries?
