# Site Details Charter: Complete Coordinate Entry Workflow

## Investigation Plan

**EXPLORE:** Complete site details workflow including file upload and manual coordinate entry options  
**AS:** Marine licensing applicants (see References)  
**BECAUSE:** Site location provision is universally challenging and critical to application accuracy  
**LOOKING FOR:** Usability issues in location workflows, file type decisions, validation clarity, decision confidence, error recovery patterns  
**NOTE:** Some advanced back/cancel navigation scenarios from coordinate entry pages are marked @wip (ML-35, ML-36)

**Duration:** 100 minutes  
**Priority:** High

## Scenario Context

**Research Insights on Coordinate Entry:**

**Sarah (Discovery-First)**: _"The coordinates threw me off a bit"_ and _"Struggled a bit with finding the location on the map... Drew a triangle. Guessed with it"_ - Coordinate concepts create anxiety for non-technical users

**Marcus (Infrastructure)**: _"I am not a GIS person... I would lean on ABP Mayor to provide files to upload, not an expert in the locations"_ - Professional reliance on specialists

**Dr. James (Research)**: _"I've worked with ArcGIS which would give you points"_ - Technical competence but seeks validation

**Elena (Multi-Project)**: Professional coordinator patterns working with client-provided location data

**Critical Research Finding**: _"Even organisational pro users find providing location details the most challenging"_ - Universal difficulty across all user types.

## Realistic Activities

- Test complete file upload workflow: location method selection ‚Üí file type choice (KML vs Shapefile) ‚Üí upload process ‚Üí validation scenarios
- Investigate file upload validation patterns: virus detection, file size limits (50MB), empty files, wrong file types
- Test file upload progress indication and error recovery patterns for both KML and Shapefile workflows
- Test complete manual coordinate entry workflow: manual selection ‚Üí circle vs polygon choice ‚Üí coordinate system selection ‚Üí coordinate entry ‚Üí review
- Investigate polygon coordinate entry: three-point triangular site definition for both WGS84 and OSGB36 systems
- Test coordinate validation across different entry methods: circle (single point + width) vs polygon (multiple coordinate points)
- Evaluate file type selection decisions based on user's existing data formats (Marcus's reliance on GIS specialists providing files)
- Evaluate help text effectiveness for understanding file type differences between KML and Shapefile formats
- Investigate coordinate system selection confidence (WGS84 vs OSGB36) across different user technical backgrounds
- Test centre point coordinate entry accuracy for circular sites with realistic scenarios
- Test polygon coordinate entry accuracy: start/end point, point 2, point 3 for triangular site boundaries
- Evaluate decimal place precision understanding (6 decimal places for WGS84, digit requirements for OSGB36)
- Test coordinate range validation (latitude -90 to 90, longitude -180 to 180, positive values for OSGB36)
- Investigate width entry validation and units comprehension for circular sites
- Test review screen comprehension and completion confidence for both file upload and manual entry workflows
- Evaluate error recovery patterns for coordinate validation failures across different coordinate systems
- Test navigation flow and state preservation through the complete workflow for all site entry methods
- Simulate scenarios where users have existing coordinate data but are uncertain about system choice
- Test help text effectiveness for coordinate system guidance across file upload and manual entry contexts
- Investigate professional workflows with prepared coordinate data or files from GIS specialists
- Test file upload interruption and resume scenarios, including browser navigation during upload process
- Evaluate upload spinner effectiveness and user understanding of processing time for different file sizes

## Evidence Framework

### ‚úÖ Positive signals

- **Decision confidence**: Clear understanding of coordinate system choices and consequences across file upload and manual entry
- **Entry accuracy**: Users can successfully enter valid coordinates for circular and polygon sites
- **File upload success**: Clear upload progress and successful file processing for both KML and Shapefile formats
- **Validation support**: Error messages help users correct coordinate problems and file upload issues
- **Workflow completion**: Users successfully progress through entire coordinate entry or file upload sequences
- **Professional integration**: Workflow accommodates existing professional coordinate data and file formats

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning signs

- **System confusion**: Uncertainty about WGS84 vs OSGB36 choice or consequences across entry methods
- **Entry errors**: Frequent coordinate validation failures or format confusion in manual entry workflows
- **File upload problems**: Confusion about file formats, upload failures, or unclear progress indication
- **Validation frustration**: Error messages don't help users understand or fix problems across different workflows
- **Workflow abandonment**: Users get stuck or confused in coordinate entry or file upload sequences
- **Professional friction**: Interface doesn't accommodate professional data workflows or file formats

### ü§î Questions to investigate

- How do users decide between file upload and manual entry based on their available data?
- What factors influence file type selection (KML vs Shapefile) for users with existing coordinate files?
- How do users with different geospatial knowledge approach coordinate system selection across entry methods?
- How do polygon coordinate entry patterns differ from circular site entry in terms of user confidence?
- What strategies do users employ when coordinate entry validation fails across different coordinate systems?
- How do users understand decimal place precision requirements for different coordinate systems and entry methods?
- What happens when users try to enter coordinates outside valid ranges in manual entry workflows?
- How effectively does the review screen build confidence in coordinate accuracy for different site types?
- How do file upload error recovery patterns compare to manual entry validation recovery?
- What upload progress expectations do users have for different file sizes and types?

### üí° Ideas to explore

- Could file type selection guidance better explain when to use KML vs Shapefile?
- Are there opportunities to help users identify their file type before selection?
- Could coordinate system selection guidance be more accessible to non-technical users across entry methods?
- Are there opportunities to better validate coordinate accuracy during manual entry?
- How might polygon coordinate entry be made clearer for users unfamiliar with boundary definition?
- What additional context would help users verify their coordinate entries across different site types?
- Could file upload progress indication be enhanced to reduce user anxiety during processing?
- How might error messaging be improved to guide users between file upload and manual entry alternatives?
