# Site Details Charter: Location Method & Coordinate System Selection

## Investigation Plan

**EXPLORE:** Site location selection options and coordinate system choices  
**AS:** Marine licensing applicants (see References)  
**BECAUSE:** Spatial data selection is critical to application accuracy  
**LOOKING FOR:** Usability issues in selection screens, navigation problems, validation clarity

**Duration:** 85 minutes  
**Priority:** High

## Scenario Context

- Focus: How users with varying geospatial knowledge interact with site details selection screens (location method, shape type, coordinate system).
- For detailed requirements and persona context, see References above.

## Realistic Activities

- Test switching between file upload and manual entry.
- Evaluate understanding and guidance for circle vs. polygon.
- Assess coordinate system selection and help features.
- Test navigation, back/cancel, and error recovery patterns.
- Try with different levels of user confidence and technical knowledge.

## Evidence Framework

### ‚úÖ Positive signals

- Conceptual clarity, selection confidence, navigation fluency, validation helpfulness, selection persistence.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning signs

- Terminology confusion, selection uncertainty, navigation disorientation, validation frustration, session issues.

### ü§î Questions to investigate

- How do users with different geospatial knowledge approach the screens?
- What mental models do users have about site boundaries and locations?
- How do users decide between circle and polygon?
- What factors influence coordinate system selection?

### üí° Ideas to explore

- Could selection guidance be improved for non-technical users?
- Are there opportunities for smarter defaults?
- How might the interface better support coordinate system selection?
- What additional context would help users make informed selections?
