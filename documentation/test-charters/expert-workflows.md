# Expert Workflows Charter: Professional User Patterns

## Investigation Plan

**EXPLORE:** How professional users navigate the delivered task list and coordinate entry workflows  
**AS:** Organisational applicants, consultants, and experienced users (see References)  
**BECAUSE:** Professional users may have different patterns and expectations for government service interactions  
**LOOKING FOR:** Efficiency barriers, professional workflow mismatches, terminology confusion, decision friction

**Duration:** 90 minutes  
**Priority:** High

## Scenario Context

**Focus**: How professional users complete the delivered exemption notification workflow efficiently, working within their organisational contexts and professional constraints.

**Beta Research Note**: Research shows professional users struggle with location details and coordinate concepts - even though file upload isn't implemented, test the decision-making and confidence in the current coordinate system selection.

## Realistic Activities

- Test rapid completion of the delivered task list workflow (project name ‚Üí activity description ‚Üí public register ‚Üí site details selection)
- Simulate professional context: client deadlines, interruptions, working with prepared information
- Test coordinate system decision-making with realistic professional scenarios (survey data, GIS outputs, existing planning documentation)
- Investigate terminology comprehension and confidence across coordinate entry choices
- Test professional expectations around data validation and error messaging
- Simulate scenarios where professionals need to gather additional information mid-application

## Evidence Framework

### ‚úÖ Positive signals

- **Professional efficiency**: Clear task progression, appropriate terminology, efficient form completion
- **Decision confidence**: Good guidance for coordinate system selection, clear consequences of choices
- **Professional integration**: Terminology aligns with industry standards, validation supports professional data quality

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning signs

- **Workflow friction**: Forced linear progression that conflicts with professional working patterns, unclear progress saving
- **Terminology barriers**: Coordinate system descriptions that don't match professional usage, unclear technical requirements
- **Decision uncertainty**: Unclear consequences of coordinate system choices, lack of guidance for professional use cases

### ü§î Questions to investigate

- How do professional users approach coordinate system selection when they have existing GIS data?
- What happens when professionals need to consult colleagues or documentation during the application?
- How well does the current workflow support professional patterns of gathering and validating information?
- Are there mismatches between professional terminology and system language?

### üí° Ideas to explore

- Could coordinate system guidance better reflect professional mapping workflows?
- Are there opportunities for clearer technical validation messages that align with professional quality standards?
- How might the interface better communicate the current state and next steps to professional users?
- What patterns from professional planning workflows could inform the current design?
