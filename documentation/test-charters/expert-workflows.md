# Expert Workflows Charter: Veteran User Efficiency

## Investigation Plan

**EXPLORE:** Efficiency patterns and workflow optimisation across delivered features  
**AS:** Experienced marine licensing applicants and maritime consultants (see References)  
**BECAUSE:** Veteran users expect streamlined workflows and professional efficiency  
**LOOKING FOR:** Workflow friction, missing shortcuts, efficiency barriers, professional workflow gaps

**Duration:** 75 minutes  
**Priority:** High

## Scenario Context

- Focus: How experienced users complete applications efficiently, often managing multiple projects simultaneously.
- For detailed requirements and persona context, see References above.

## Realistic Activities

- Test rapid navigation and keyboard shortcuts.
- Attempt to reuse information from previous applications.
- Simulate multi-application management and interruptions.
- Test professional site details selection and consent decisions.
- Evaluate workflow for speed, accuracy, and professional presentation.

## Evidence Framework

### ‚úÖ Positive signals

- Keyboard navigation fluency, recognition over recall, workflow continuity, multi-application support, professional presentation.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning signs

- Efficiency barriers, pattern disruption, navigation inefficiency, multi-tab conflicts, professional friction.

### ü§î Questions to investigate

- How does application speed compare to other government services professionals use?
- What happens when users need to manage multiple applications simultaneously?
- How well does the interface support professional client interaction patterns?
- Are there opportunities for data reuse between related applications?

### üí° Ideas to explore

- Could keyboard shortcuts be added for common professional workflows?
- Are there opportunities for smart defaults based on user behaviour patterns?
- How might the interface better support multi-application management?
- What efficiency features would enhance professional confidence?
