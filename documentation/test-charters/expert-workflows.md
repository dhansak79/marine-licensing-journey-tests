# Expert Workflows Charter: Professional User Patterns

## Investigation Plan

**EXPLORE:** Professional efficiency patterns across complete exemption notification workflow  
**AS:** Organisational applicants, consultants, and experienced users (see References)  
**BECAUSE:** Professional users have established workflows and efficiency expectations that may not align with current design  
**LOOKING FOR:** Workflow friction, professional terminology mismatches, efficiency barriers, decision confidence issues

**Duration:** 90 minutes  
**Priority:** High

## Scenario Context

**Research Insights from Professional Users:**

**Marcus (Infrastructure Professional)**: _"Best thing MMO ever did was introduce the self service tool. I use it pretty regularly."_ - 27+ years experience, values efficiency and system continuity.

**Elena (Multi-Project Coordinator)**: _"One of the pain points is repeating info. Very glad to see this."_ - Consultant applying for multiple clients, needs project linking capabilities.

**Dr. James (Research Practitioner)**: _"I would have a summary doc to copy from which would give context of the research, what you hope to find, justification."_ - Academic precision needs, documentation standards.

**Focus**: How professional users complete exemption notifications efficiently within organisational contexts and professional constraints, using delivered functionality.

## Realistic Activities

- Test rapid completion of complete workflow with prepared information (project name ‚Üí dates ‚Üí description ‚Üí register ‚Üí site details)
- Simulate professional context: client deadlines, interruptions, working with prepared coordinate data or files
- Test file upload efficiency with professional GIS files: KML vs Shapefile selection based on existing data
- Evaluate file upload integration with professional workflows: GIS specialist-generated files, CAD exports
- Test polygon coordinate entry efficiency for complex site boundaries with professional precision requirements
- Test coordinate system decision-making with realistic professional scenarios (existing survey data, GIS outputs)
- Investigate activity description completion with professional documentation standards vs character limits
- Test public register consent decision patterns for different organisational contexts
- Evaluate site details workflow efficiency for professionals with existing coordinate data across entry methods
- Test validation responses with professional expectations for data quality and accuracy
- Simulate scenarios where professionals need to consult colleagues or documentation mid-application
- Test professional expectations around data validation and error messaging quality across coordinate entry and file upload
- Investigate efficiency patterns when professionals have incomplete information or need to switch between entry methods

## Evidence Framework

### ‚úÖ Positive signals

- **Professional efficiency**: Streamlined task progression, appropriate terminology, efficient form completion
- **Decision confidence**: Clear guidance for coordinate system selection based on existing data
- **Quality alignment**: Validation supports professional data quality standards
- **Context adaptation**: Interface accommodates professional vs individual use cases
- **Workflow integration**: Service fits with existing professional processes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning signs

- **Efficiency barriers**: Forced linear progression conflicts with professional working patterns
- **Terminology mismatches**: System language doesn't align with professional usage
- **Decision uncertainty**: Unclear consequences of choices, inadequate guidance for professional contexts
- **Quality friction**: Validation doesn't match professional standards or expectations
- **Context confusion**: Interface assumes individual rather than organisational usage

### ü§î Questions to investigate

- How do professional users approach coordinate system selection when they have existing GIS data?
- Does the activity description character limit accommodate professional documentation needs?
- How well does the current public register decision support different organisational contexts?
- What happens when professionals need to adapt prepared information to fit form requirements?
- Do validation messages meet professional expectations for technical accuracy?

### üí° Ideas to explore

- Could coordinate system guidance better reflect professional mapping workflows?
- Are there opportunities for professional templates or information reuse patterns?
- How might validation messages better align with professional quality standards?
- Could the interface better distinguish between individual and organisational usage patterns?
