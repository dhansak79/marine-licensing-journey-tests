# Review and Submission Charter: Final Stage Conversion Patterns

## Investigation Plan

**EXPLORE:** Check your answers review and notification submission workflow  
**AS:** All user types at the critical conversion point (see References)  
**BECAUSE:** Final review and submission represents the highest-risk conversion point where users commit to their application  
**LOOKING FOR:** Review confidence issues, submission anxiety, information verification patterns, confirmation comprehension, application reference understanding

**Duration:** 70 minutes  
**Priority:** High

## Scenario Context

**Research Insights on Final Stages:**

**Sarah (Discovery-First)**: _"I'd probably ring someone if got stuck"_ and _"I'd get an email. Because I've put those coords in wrong"_ - High anxiety about accuracy at submission point

**Dr. James (Research)**: _"I would have a summary doc to copy from which would give context of the research"_ - Professional verification needs against source documentation

**Marcus (Infrastructure)**: _"I'd give it a sense-check to see if it ties in with landmarks"_ - Professional validation patterns for accuracy verification

**Elena (Multi-Project)**: Professional accountability for client accuracy and submission completeness

**Focus**: How users approach the final review and submission stages, including confidence building, accuracy verification, and submission commitment across different user contexts.

## Realistic Activities

- Test complete check your answers page comprehension and information verification patterns
- Investigate review confidence for coordinate information display (both WGS84 and OSGB36 formats)
- Test activity information review accuracy and completeness checking
- Evaluate public register consent confirmation and understanding
- Test declaration comprehension and submission confidence
- Investigate "Confirm and send" button interaction and commitment patterns
- Test confirmation page comprehension and application reference understanding
- Evaluate application reference format recognition (EXE/2025/XXXXX) and next steps clarity
- Simulate review scenarios with deliberate information errors to test detection patterns
- Test review patterns under time pressure and professional accountability contexts
- Investigate interruption recovery and session resumption at review stage
- Test accessibility of review and confirmation pages with assistive technology
- Evaluate review patterns for users with incomplete understanding of previous choices
- Test review confidence across different complexity scenarios (WGS84 vs OSGB36, different activity types)

## Evidence Framework

### ‚úÖ Positive signals

- **Review confidence**: Users can verify information accuracy and feel confident proceeding
- **Error detection**: Users notice and correct information problems during review
- **Submission clarity**: Clear understanding of what happens when they submit
- **Confirmation comprehension**: Users understand confirmation page and application reference
- **Next steps clarity**: Users know what to expect after submission

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning signs

- **Review anxiety**: Users uncertain about information accuracy but proceed anyway
- **Error blindness**: Users miss obvious information problems during review
- **Submission hesitation**: Users uncertain about consequences of submitting
- **Confirmation confusion**: Users don't understand confirmation page or reference number
- **Process uncertainty**: Users unclear about what happens next after submission

### ü§î Questions to investigate

- How effectively do users verify coordinate information accuracy in the check your answers summary?
- What review patterns differ between WGS84 (lat/long) and OSGB36 (eastings/northings) coordinate displays?
- How do users interpret the declaration and submission commitment language?
- Do users understand the application reference format and its significance?
- How do different personas approach final accuracy checking given their professional responsibilities?
- What happens when users want to change information during review?

### üí° Ideas to explore

- Could coordinate information be displayed more clearly for verification confidence?
- Are there opportunities to improve submission commitment clarity?
- How might the confirmation page better support user understanding of next steps?
- Could application reference explanation be enhanced for different user contexts?
- What verification aids might help users catch errors during review?
