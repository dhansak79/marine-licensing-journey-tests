# Back and Cancel Navigation Charter: Cross-Workflow Consistency Investigation

## Investigation Plan

**EXPLORE:** Back and cancel navigation behaviour across the complete exemption notification workflow  
**AS:** All user types encountering navigation decisions (see References)  
**BECAUSE:** Inconsistent navigation behaviour creates user confusion and breaks workflow expectations  
**LOOKING FOR:** Navigation inconsistencies, data preservation issues, destination confusion, pattern violations across delivered functionality

**Duration:** 90 minutes  
**Priority:** High

## Scenario Context

**Critical Navigation Patterns Identified:**

From user story analysis, there are **at least 3 different navigation patterns** across delivered functionality:

1. **Standard Pattern**: "Cancel" returns to task list, "Back" returns to previous page (ML-10, ML-11, ML-12)
2. **Site Details Pattern**: "Cancel" returns to task list with data discard, "Back" preserves selections (ML-16, ML-17, ML-18, ML-35, ML-36, ML-37)
3. **Review Pattern**: "Go back to your project" instead of standard Cancel/Back (ML-82, ML-84)

**Key Research Insight**: Users expect consistent navigation patterns across similar contexts, and violations of established patterns create confusion and potential data loss anxiety.

**Focus**: How navigation consistency (or lack thereof) affects user confidence, workflow efficiency, and task completion across the complete exemption notification journey.

## Realistic Activities

- **Pattern Mapping**: Document actual back/cancel behaviour across all delivered pages systematically
- **Consistency Verification**: Test navigation expectations - do users end up where they expect?
- **Data Preservation Investigation**: Test what happens to user data when using back vs cancel across different contexts
- **Cross-Section Analysis**: Navigate between different workflow sections and test boundary behaviour
- **Error Recovery Scenarios**: Test navigation behaviour after validation errors - does back/cancel work consistently?
- **Multi-Context Testing**: Test navigation with partially completed data, validation errors, and session restoration
- **Language Consistency**: Verify button text, link text, and messaging consistency across all navigation points
- **Sequential Navigation**: Test back‚Üíback‚Üíback chains across workflow sections to identify routing issues
- **Interruption Recovery**: Test navigation behaviour when returning to partially completed workflows
- **Task Status Integration**: Verify how navigation affects task completion status in different contexts

## Evidence Framework

### ‚úÖ Positive signals

- **Consistent behaviour**: Back/cancel function identically across similar contexts
- **Predictable destinations**: Users land where they expect after navigation actions
- **Data safety**: Clear and consistent data preservation/discard patterns
- **Status integrity**: Task completion status behaves predictably with navigation
- **Language consistency**: Button/link text follows established patterns throughout

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning signs

- **Pattern violations**: Different navigation behaviour in similar contexts without clear reason
- **Destination confusion**: Navigation takes users to unexpected locations
- **Data loss anxiety**: Unclear what happens to entered data when navigating
- **Status inconsistencies**: Task completion status doesn't match navigation behaviour
- **Language variations**: Inconsistent button/link text for same functionality

### ü§î Questions to investigate

- Do "Cancel" buttons consistently return to the task list across all contexts?
- Does "Back" behaviour match user expectations throughout the site details workflow?
- Why does the review section use "Go back to your project" instead of standard navigation?
- How does navigation interact with validation errors and form state preservation?
- Are there contexts where navigation behaviour should differ, and are these differences justified?

### üí° Ideas to explore

- Could navigation patterns be standardised across similar workflow contexts?
- Are there opportunities to improve data preservation clarity during navigation?
- How might consistent navigation language improve user confidence?
- What navigation behaviour would best support different user types (novice vs expert)?
