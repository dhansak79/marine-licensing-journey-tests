**Duration:** 90 minutes  
**Priority:** High

## Scenario Context

- Focus: The complete exemption notification journey for users new to marine licensing and government digital services.
- For detailed requirements and persona context, see References above.

## Realistic Activities

- Attempt to complete the journey without reading all guidance first.
- Test understanding of project name, task list, activity description, public register, and site details.
- Use help features when confused; test error recovery and accessibility.
- Simulate interruptions, incomplete information, and resuming work.
- Test with assistive technology and different devices.

## Evidence Framework

### ‚úÖ Positive signals

- Guidance clarity, error prevention, progress transparency, accessibility support, confidence building.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning signs

- Terminology confusion, navigation disorientation, error frustration, accessibility barriers, abandonment risk.

### ü§î Questions to investigate

- How does the application compare to other government services novices might know?
- What happens when users need to gather additional information mid-application?
- How well does the interface support users who are uncertain about decisions?
- Are there cultural or language barriers that affect comprehension?

### üí° Ideas to explore

- Could terminology be explained more clearly or contextually?
- Are there opportunities for progressive disclosure of complex information?
- How might the interface better support uncertain or anxious users?
- What patterns from familiar services could improve the experience?
