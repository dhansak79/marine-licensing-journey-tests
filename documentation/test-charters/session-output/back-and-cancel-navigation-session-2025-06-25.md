# Back and Cancel Navigation Session Output

**SESSION:** Back and Cancel Navigation Investigation - 2024-12-21
**DURATION:** 30 minutes
**INVESTIGATOR:** AI Assistant (via Playwright MCP tools)

## NAVIGATION PATTERN MAPPING

### Standard Pattern Pages (ML-10, ML-11, ML-12)

**Project Name (ML-1):**

- Back behaviour: No back button present
- Cancel behaviour: No cancel button present
- Data handling: N/A - entry point

**Activity Dates (ML-10):**

- Back behaviour: Returns to task list (`/exemption/task-list`)
- Cancel behaviour: Returns to task list (`/exemption/task-list`)
- Data handling: Cancel discards unsaved data (tested with day field "15")

**Activity Description (ML-11):**

- Back behaviour: Returns to task list (`/exemption/task-list`)
- Cancel behaviour: Returns to task list (`/exemption/task-list`)
- Data handling: Not tested, but expected to discard like ML-10

**Public Register (ML-12):**

- Back behaviour: Returns to task list (`/exemption/task-list`)
- Cancel behaviour: Returns to task list (`/exemption/task-list`)
- Data handling: Not tested, but expected to discard like ML-10

### Site Details Pattern Pages (ML-16, ML-17, ML-18, ML-35)

**Site Location Method (ML-16):**

- Back behaviour: Returns to task list (`/exemption/task-list`)
- Cancel behaviour: Returns to task list with query parameter (`/exemption/task-list?cancel=site-details`)
- Data handling: N/A - first page of flow

**Coordinate Entry Type (ML-17):**

- Back behaviour: Returns to previous step (`/exemption/how-do-you-want-to-provide-the-coordinates`)
- Cancel behaviour: Returns to task list with query parameter (`/exemption/task-list?cancel=site-details`)
- Data handling: Back preserves selection (circular site option remained checked)

**Coordinate System (ML-18):**

- Back behaviour: Returns to previous step (`/exemption/how-do-you-want-to-enter-the-coordinates`)
- Cancel behaviour: Returns to task list with query parameter (`/exemption/task-list?cancel=site-details`)
- Data handling: Not tested individually

**Centre Point Entry (ML-35):**

- Back behaviour: Returns to previous step (`/exemption/what-coordinate-system`)
- Cancel behaviour: Returns to task list with query parameter (`/exemption/task-list?cancel=site-details`)
- Data handling: Cancel discards entire site details flow data (all selections cleared when returning)

## CONSISTENCY FINDINGS

### ‚úÖ Consistent behaviours across similar contexts:

- All standard pattern pages (ML-10, ML-11, ML-12) behave identically
- All site details pages use consistent Cancel destination with query parameter
- Button placement is consistent (Back at top, Cancel at bottom)
- Navigation works consistently during validation errors

### ‚ùå Inconsistent behaviours requiring explanation:

- **Different Back behaviour between patterns:**
  - Standard pattern: Back always returns to task list
  - Site details pattern: Back returns to previous step in flow
- **Cancel URL variation:**
  - Standard pattern: `/exemption/task-list`
  - Site details pattern: `/exemption/task-list?cancel=site-details`
- **Button text variation:**
  - Standard pattern: "Save and continue"
  - Site details pattern: "Continue" (no save)

### ü§î Unclear or confusing navigation patterns:

- The query parameter `?cancel=site-details` purpose is unclear - no visible difference in behaviour observed
- No clear visual indication that site details is a multi-step sub-flow

### üí° Potential improvements for consistency:

- Consider standardising Cancel behaviour across all pages
- Add visual indicators for multi-step workflows
- Consider consistent button text ("Continue" vs "Save and continue")

## DELIVERED FEATURE ANALYSIS

**Button/Link Text:**

- Back: Consistent "Back" text across all pages
- Cancel: Consistent "Cancel" text across all pages
- Action buttons: Varies between "Save and continue" and "Continue"

**Destination Accuracy:**

- All navigation destinations work as coded
- No broken links or incorrect destinations found

**Data Preservation:**

- Cancel always discards unsaved data (as expected)
- Back in site details preserves selections within the flow
- Back in standard pattern doesn't preserve unsaved data

**Task Status Impact:**

- Tasks remain "Incomplete" when cancelled
- No orphaned data or incorrect status changes observed

**Error Context:**

- Navigation buttons remain functional during validation errors
- Back and Cancel destinations unchanged by error state
- Error messages don't affect navigation behaviour

## USER IMPACT ASSESSMENT

**Sarah (Discovery-First):**

- May be confused by different Back behaviours
- Site details multi-step flow could cause anxiety about progress
- Clear Cancel behaviour helps escape if overwhelmed

**Marcus (Infrastructure):**

- Predictable Cancel behaviour supports efficient workflow
- Back behaviour variation might slow down navigation
- Query parameter in Cancel URL has no visible purpose

**Elena (Multi-Project):**

- Data loss on Cancel is clear and consistent
- Back behaviour difference between sections could cause errors
- No data contamination between projects observed

**Dr. James (Research):**

- Site details flow preserves data with Back navigation
- Cancel safely discards all temporary data
- Validation errors don't trap users

## CROSS-WORKFLOW BOUNDARY TESTING

**Task List ‚Üî Individual Tasks:**

- Clean entry/exit for standard pattern tasks
- Site details has special Cancel parameter but no visible difference

**Site Details Sub-Flow:**

- Internal navigation works as multi-step wizard
- Back preserves progress within flow
- Cancel discards entire flow (not just current page)

**Review Stage:**

- Not tested (pages not accessible without completing tasks)

**Error Recovery:**

- Navigation remains functional during validation errors
- No navigation state corruption observed

## POTENTIAL INCONSISTENCIES IDENTIFIED

**Critical Issues:**

- None identified - navigation works as designed

**Minor Issues:**

- Inconsistent Back behaviour between task types could confuse users
- Purpose of `?cancel=site-details` query parameter unclear
- Button text inconsistency ("Save and continue" vs "Continue")

**Pattern Violations:**

- Site details uses different navigation pattern without clear indication
- No visual cues that site details is a multi-step sub-flow

**Language Issues:**

- Button text varies but is generally clear
- No misleading navigation labels found

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

‚òê Document the two navigation patterns clearly for users
‚òê Consider adding visual indicators for multi-step flows
‚òê Review purpose of `?cancel=site-details` query parameter
‚òê Consider standardising button text across all pages
‚òê Add user guidance about data preservation vs discard behaviour
