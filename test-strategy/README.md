2. Plan first [Investigation Session](./investigative-testing.md) with MMO domain expert
3. Establish rhythm of automation + investigation

### **🌊 For MMO Domain Experts**

1. Try 60-minute [Simple Investigation](./investigative-testing.md#-simple-investigation-sessions) on familiar workflow
2. Share findings with team, identify next investigation area
3. Regular investigation sessions on high-risk areas

### **👨‍💼 For Project Managers and Stakeholders**

1. Review [Success Measures](#-success-measures) to understand quality indicators
2. Include investigation time in work planning
3. Track automation health + investigation insights

### **🆕 For New Team Members**

1. **Start here**: Read this overview (10 minutes)
2. **Understand context**: [Domain Context](./domain-context.md) (20 minutes)
3. **Pick your role**: Follow relevant path above

## 🎯 Key Principles

1. **Context-driven testing** - Strategy adapts to marine licensing domain needs
2. **Automation-first foundation** - Reliable regression protection and fast feedback
3. **Strategic human insight** - Investigation where domain expertise matters most
4. **Whole-team quality** - Testing is everyone's responsibility
5. **Evidence-based decisions** - Data and metrics guide testing investments

## 📋 Current Focus: Private Beta Exemption Notifications

**What we're building**: Public exemption notification service for Marine Management Organisation (MMO)

**Testing priorities**:

- ✅ **Core exemption workflow** - Complete user journey validation
- ✅ **Public user experience** - Accessibility and usability for external users
- ✅ **Essential functionality** - Reliable operation of notification features
- ✅ **Beta readiness** - Quality validation for limited user testing
