# Accessibility Testing - Inclusive Design & GOV.UK Compliance

This section covers **accessibility testing**, **inclusive design practices**, and **government accessibility compliance** for marine licensing applications.

## üéØ Accessibility Requirements

### **Government Hub Digital Service (GHDS) Compliance**

The marine licensing service must pass assessment against **GHDS accessibility requirements**, ensuring compliance with:

- **WCAG 2.1 AA standards** - Legal requirement for public sector services
- **Government accessibility regulations** - Section 508 and related compliance frameworks
- **Inclusive design principles** - Ensuring accessibility from design through implementation

### **Windows 11 / Office 365 Ease of Access Compatibility**

The service must be compatible with standard Microsoft accessibility tools:

- **Dictate** - Voice recognition for hands-free input
- **Magnify** - Screen magnification for visual accessibility
- **Narrate / Read Aloud** - Built-in screen reader functionality

### **Defra Corporate Assistive Technology**

The service must demonstrate compatibility with Defra group's corporate assistive technology software:

- **Dragon** - Professional voice recognition software
- **JAWS** - Industry-standard screen reader
- **Read and Write** - Screen reader and literacy support software
- **ZoomText** - Combined screen magnifier and screen reader

## üß™ Testing Approach

### **Automated Accessibility Testing**

- **axe-core integration** - Automated WCAG compliance scanning in test pipeline
- **Continuous validation** - Accessibility checks as part of automated test suite
- **Regression protection** - Ensure accessibility doesn't degrade with changes

### **Manual Assistive Technology Testing**

#### **Screen Reader Testing**

- **JAWS compatibility** - Professional screen reader used across government
- **Built-in screen readers** - Windows Narrator and browser screen readers
- **Cross-platform validation** - Ensure consistent experience across different screen readers

#### **Voice Recognition Testing**

- **Dragon compatibility** - Professional voice control software testing
- **Windows Dictate** - Built-in voice recognition functionality
- **Voice navigation** - Complete user journeys using voice commands only

#### **Screen Magnification Testing**

- **ZoomText compatibility** - Combined magnification and screen reader testing
- **Windows Magnify** - Built-in magnification tool validation
- **High contrast and zoom** - Testing at 200% and 400% magnification levels

### **Keyboard Navigation Testing**

- **Complete workflow accessibility** - All functions available via keyboard
- **Tab order validation** - Logical navigation sequence through forms and interfaces
- **Focus management** - Clear visual indicators and appropriate focus handling
- **Keyboard shortcuts** - Efficient navigation for power users

## üé≠ Accessibility Personas Integration

### **Testing with Accessibility Needs**

Our marine licensing personas include accessibility considerations:

- **Zofia (Novice Applicant)** - May use screen readers or magnification
- **Fatima (Case Officer)** - Keyboard navigation efficiency for professional use
- **Simon (Marine Officer)** - Mobile accessibility for field work
- **Amy (Veteran Applicant)** - Voice recognition for efficiency

### **Realistic Accessibility Scenarios**

- **Screen reader navigation** - Complete exemption application using JAWS
- **Voice control workflows** - Form completion using Dragon voice recognition
- **High magnification usage** - Application process at 400% zoom with ZoomText
- **Keyboard-only navigation** - Complete user journey without mouse interaction

## üîÑ Accessibility Testing Integration

### **Development Workflow**

- **Accessibility-first design** - Consider assistive technology from design phase
- **Automated quality gates** - Accessibility validation in CI/CD pipeline
- **Manual testing cadence** - Regular validation with corporate assistive technology
- **User feedback integration** - Incorporate accessibility insights from real users

### **Cross-Team Collaboration**

- **Design system compliance** - Use GOV.UK Design System accessible patterns
- **Content design validation** - Plain English and clear language principles
- **Developer training** - Semantic HTML and ARIA best practices
- **Quality assurance** - Assistive technology testing expertise and support

## üìä Accessibility Success Metrics

### **Compliance Indicators**

- **WCAG 2.1 AA achievement** - Zero critical accessibility violations
- **Assistive technology compatibility** - Successful operation with all required tools
- **User task completion** - High success rates across accessibility scenarios
- **Performance standards** - Acceptable response times with assistive technology

### **Quality Measures**

- **Screen reader announcement clarity** - Logical and helpful content presentation
- **Voice recognition accuracy** - Reliable command recognition and form completion
- **Magnification usability** - Interface remains functional at high zoom levels
- **Keyboard navigation efficiency** - Streamlined workflows for keyboard users

## üöÄ Implementation Roadmap

### **Foundation Phase**
