## 🌊 The Challenge We're Solving

### **We're Building Something New**

- Public exemption notification service for MMO
- External users (not internal MMO staff)
- Real regulatory consequences if we get it wrong
- Private beta launch approaching

### **Traditional Testing Isn't Enough**

- ✅ **Automation** catches known issues
- ❌ **But what about the unknown unknowns?**
- ❌ **User experience problems?**
- ❌ **Edge cases we haven't thought of?**

### **We Need Human Insight**

> **"The hard part isn't writing the code, it's understanding what should be tested and how"**

---

## 🔍 Concept 1: Session-Based Test Management

### **What Is It?**

**Structured exploration** with clear goals and time boundaries

### **Think of It Like...**

- **User research session** - but focused on finding problems
- **Design critique** - but for the whole user journey
- **Code review** - but for user experience and functionality

### **Key Elements:**

```
📋 CHARTER: What are we investigating?
⏰ TIME BOX: Usually 60-90 minutes
👥 PARTICIPANTS: Domain expert + fresh eyes
📝 NOTES: What we found, questions raised
🎯 OUTCOME: Actionable insights
```

### **Why This Works:**

- **Focused effort** - not random clicking around
- **Documented findings** - knowledge doesn't disappear
- **Collaborative** - combines different perspectives
- **Efficient** - maximum insight in minimum time

---

## 🕵️ Concept 2: Investigative Testing

### **What Is It?**

**Human-led exploration** to discover risks automation can't find

### **Different from UAT Because:**

| **Traditional UAT**          | **Investigative Testing** |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| "Does it work as specified?" | "What could go wrong?"    |
| Follow test scripts          | Explore and question      |
| Pass/fail mindset            | Discovery mindset         |
| End-of-process check         | Throughout development    |

### **What We're Looking For:**

- **Usability problems** - "This is confusing"
- **Missing scenarios** - "What if someone does X?"
- **Edge cases** - "This breaks when..."
- **Accessibility issues** - "Screen readers can't..."
- **Real-world constraints** - "Users won't have..."

### **Example Investigation Questions:**

- What happens if someone starts but doesn't finish?
- How does this work on a mobile phone?
- What if the user doesn't understand marine licensing terms?
- Could someone accidentally submit the wrong information?
- What if the user's internet connection is slow?

## 📋 Concept 3: Test Charters

### **What Is It?**

**A mission statement** for each investigation session

### **Charter Template:**

```
🎯 EXPLORE: [Area of the application]
👀 WITH: [Specific focus or perspective]
🔍 TO DISCOVER: [Types of problems or information]
```

### **Real Examples:**

#### **For Content Designer:**

```
🎯 EXPLORE: Exemption notification form
👀 WITH: Plain English and accessibility lens
🔍 TO DISCOVER: Language barriers and comprehension issues
```

#### **For Domain Expert:**

```
🎯 EXPLORE: Project details section
👀 WITH: Real-world marine licensing knowledge
🔍 TO DISCOVER: Missing information or unrealistic requirements
```

#### **For UX Designer:**

```
🎯 EXPLORE: Complete user journey
👀 WITH: First-time user perspective
🔍 TO DISCOVER: Navigation problems and user confusion points
```

### **Why Charters Matter:**

- **Clear purpose** - everyone knows what we're doing
- **Focused effort** - don't try to test everything at once
- **Leverages expertise** - uses each person's unique knowledge
- **Measurable outcomes** - we know if the session was successful

## 💬 Questions & Discussion

### **Common Questions:**

**Q: "I don't know anything about marine licensing - can I still help?"**  
A: **Yes!** Fresh eyes often spot problems experts miss. We'll pair you with domain knowledge.

**Q: "How is this different from the UAT testing we already do?"**  
A: **UAT validates requirements**. Investigation discovers what we didn't think to require.

**Q: "What if we find lots of problems?"**  
A: **That's success!** Better to find them now than after launch.

**Q: "How much time commitment is this really?"**  
A: **Flexible**. Start with one session, see how it goes, adjust from there.

**Q: "What tools do we need?"**  
A: **Minimal**. Browser, notepad, curiosity. We'll provide templates and guidance.
